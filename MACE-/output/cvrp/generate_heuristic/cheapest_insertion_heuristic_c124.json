Your Solution class and operators (AppendOperator, InsertOperator) align well with representing and perturbing CVRP solutions, enabling hyper-heuristic frameworks to select or generate improvements. The provided problem_state dict structure, with categories for input data, current solution, helpers, and statistics, supports effective heuristic design by providing necessary context for operator selection.

For each vehicle in sequence, repeatedly append the nearest unvisited customer (by distance from the last node in the route) that fits the remaining capacity until no more can be added or all customers are served. Default: Use Euclidean distance if available, or matrix distance; max iterations per vehicle = node_num.\nCheapest Insertion Heuristic: Initialize with a single route per customer-depot pair. Iteratively select the unserved customer with the lowest insertion cost (increase in total route distance) and insert it into the feasible route (via InsertOperator) where the added cost is minimal, respecting capacity. Default: Insertion cost = distance savings; regret threshold = 0.1 * avg_depot_distance; run until all served.\nClarke-Wright Savings Heuristic: Begin with individual depot-customer-depot routes for all customers. Compute savings for merging adjacent routes (s_ikj = dist(i,k) + dist(j,k) - dist(i,j) where i,j are route ends, k merge point). Greedily merge routes with highest savings using InsertOperator to append segments, ensuring capacity. Default: Parallel version (merge independently); sort savings descending; stop when no feasible merges.\nSweep Heuristic: Order customers by angular position around the depot (polar angle). Start empty routes. Sweep clockwise, appending consecutive customers in angular order to the current vehicle if capacity allows (using AppendOperator); open a new vehicle when capacity exceeded. Default: Angle from positive x-axis; depot at (0,0) if coordinates available, else use distance_matrix approximation; one sweep per vehicle until all served.\nRandom Greedy Heuristic: Initialize empty routes. For each vehicle, randomly select unvisited customers that fit capacity and append them in random order (AppendOperator), preferring closer ones with probability proportional to inverse distance. Repeat until all customers assigned or vehicles exhausted. Default: Probability weight = 1 / (1 + distance); random seed from algorithm_data if provided; ensure at least 50% greedy selection ratio.\n***\n\nThese heuristics are designed to be constructive, building solutions incrementally using the provided operators (primarily AppendOperator for sequential addition, with InsertOperator for refinements in insertion-based ones). They leverage the problem_state dict: input data for distances/demands/capacity, helper functions like get_unvisited_customers, can_add_to_route, and validation_solution for feasibility checks, and statistics like spatial_clustering or remaining_demand_ratio to bias selections (e.g., in Random Greedy). Diversity comes from strategies: greedy proximity (Nearest), cost-aware insertion (Cheapest), merge-based (Savings), geometric ordering (Sweep), and stochastic (Random). For implementation, the heuristic function would return an operator instance (e.g., AppendOperator(vehicle_id, node)) and updated algorithm_data (e.g., {'partial_solution': new_solution, 'used_vehicles': count}). Post-construction, a simple 2-opt improvement could be added via additional operators if allowed, but kept minimal here. Hyper-parameters like thresholds are set with sensible defaults based on instance stats (e.g., avg_depot_distance for scaling). If coordinates are in problem_state (not explicitly listed but inferable from distance_matrix), use them for Sweep; otherwise, approximate angles via distances."
