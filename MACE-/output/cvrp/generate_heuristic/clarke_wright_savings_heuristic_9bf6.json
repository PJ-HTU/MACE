For each vehicle in sequence, repeatedly append the nearest unvisited customer (by distance from the last node in the route) that fits the remaining capacity until no more can be added or all customers are served. Default: Use Euclidean distance if available, or matrix distance; max iterations per vehicle = node_num.\nCheapest Insertion Heuristic: Initialize with a single route per customer-depot pair. Iteratively select the unserved customer with the lowest insertion cost (increase in total route distance) and insert it into the feasible route (via InsertOperator) where the added cost is minimal, respecting capacity. Default: Insertion cost = distance savings; regret threshold = 0.1 * avg_depot_distance; run until all served.\nClarke-Wright Savings Heuristic: Begin with individual depot-customer-depot routes for all customers. Compute savings for merging adjacent routes (s_ikj = dist(i,k) + dist(j,k) - dist(i,j) where i,j are route ends, k merge point). Greedily merge routes with highest savings using InsertOperator to append segments, ensuring capacity. Default: Parallel version (merge independently); sort savings descending; stop when no feasible merges.\nSweep Heuristic: Order customers by angular position around the depot (polar angle). Start empty routes. Sweep clockwise, appending consecutive customers in angular order to the current vehicle if capacity allows (using AppendOperator); open a new vehicle when capacity exceeded. Default: Angle from positive x-axis; depot at (0,0) if coordinates available, else use distance_matrix approximation; one sweep per vehicle until all served.\nRandom Greedy Heuristic: Initialize empty routes. For each vehicle, randomly select unvisited customers that fit capacity and append them in random order (AppendOperator), preferring closer ones with probability proportional to inverse distance. Repeat until all customers assigned or vehicles exhausted. Default: Probability weight = 1 / (1 + distance); random seed from algorithm_data if provided; ensure at least 50% greedy selection ratio.\n***\n\nThese heuristics are designed to be constructive, building solutions incrementally using the provided operators (primarily AppendOperator for sequential addition, with InsertOperator for refinements in insertion-based ones). They leverage the problem_state dict: input data for distances/demands/capacity, helper functions like get_unvisited_customers, can_add_to_route, and validation_solution for feasibility checks, and statistics like spatial_clustering or remaining_demand_ratio to bias selections (e.g., in Random Greedy). Diversity comes from strategies: greedy proximity (Nearest), cost-aware insertion (Cheapest), merge-based (Savings), geometric ordering (Sweep), and stochastic (Random). For implementation, the heuristic function would return an operator instance (e.g., AppendOperator(vehicle_id, node)) and updated algorithm_data (e.g., {'partial_solution': new_solution, 'used_vehicles': count}). Post-construction, a simple 2-opt improvement could be added via additional operators if allowed, but kept minimal here. Hyper-parameters like thresholds are set with sensible defaults based on instance stats (e.g., avg_depot_distance for scaling). If coordinates are in problem_state (not explicitly listed but inferable from distance_matrix), use them for Sweep; otherwise, approximate angles via distances."

It ensures validity by relying on can_add_to_route for capacity checks and get_unvisited_customers to avoid duplicates or depot inclusion. The greedy selection based on savings promotes merging-like behavior by favoring connections that save distance compared to separate servicing. Recomputing each time ensures it works with the partial current_solution without needing algorithm_data state. If the instance is infeasible (e.g., total_demand > capacity * vehicle_num), it may return None prematurely, but the prompt assumes all data is possible and feasible. For the parallel version, this sequential approximation sorts implicitly by max saving at each step; a full parallel would require precomputing and buffering in algorithm_data, but that complicates the stateless design. The code handles empty lists safely (e.g., no min on empty unvisited). After all applications, the final solution should be valid and complete, as each step preserves validity and covers all customers."

This handles cases where initial routes are empty (len(route)==0), regardless of the reported vehicles_used value, which seems inconsistent in the test (possibly counting allocated vehicles including empties). The min on unvisited is safe as it's after checking not unvisited. Node=1 is assumed to be the closest to depot (depot=0, dist[0][1] minimal). After this fix, the first call adds to vehicle 0, matching the smoke test. Subsequent calls will prefer extensions to existing routes (now vid=0 with end=1) if high saving, else start new at next available (vid=1, etc.). This ensures progressive construction toward a complete, valid solution covering all 31 customers. Removed vehicles_used from extraction and doc as it's no longer used. The code remains stateless and uses only provided helpers for validity."
