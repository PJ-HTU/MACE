It involves discrete decisions\u2014such as sequencing operations on machines while respecting job precedence constraints and machine availability\u2014to minimize objectives like makespan, which makes it inherently combinatorial. JSSP is NP-hard, so exact methods are impractical for large instances, and it's routinely solved using heuristics (e.g., dispatching rules like SPT or LPT), metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu search), and hyper-heuristics, which aligns well with your framework of selecting operators to build partial schedules incrementally.\n\nYour Solution and Operator design appears sound for a constructive heuristic approach: the job_sequences represent machine-specific permutations (building the schedule disjunctively), job_operation_sequence captures the conjunctive (job-internal) order, and job_operation_index tracks progress per job. The AdvanceOperator effectively implements a selection heuristic by advancing a specific job's next operation to its machine queue, enabling priority-based dispatching. This setup supports hyper-heuristics by allowing the selection of which job to advance next based on the provided problem_state features (e.g., using remaining workload or machine loads for informed decisions). The heuristic signature you defined is appropriate for outputting a TargetOperatorType instance (like AdvanceOperator(job_id)) and updating algorithm_data for iterative improvement. If you're implementing specific rules (e.g., Apparent Tardiness Cost or Critical Path), ensure validation_solution checks for feasibility like no machine overlaps. Overall, this is a solid foundation for hyper-heuristic application to JSSP."

Retrieve the list of schedulable jobs using the get_schedulable_jobs callable from problem_state. A schedulable job has remaining operations to schedule.\n    2. If the list is empty (all operations are scheduled), return None, {} to indicate no further action is possible (construction phase complete).\n    3. Otherwise, randomly select one job_id from the schedulable jobs list using random.choice.\n    4. Create an AdvanceOperator instance with the selected job_id, which will append the next operation of that job to the appropriate machine's sequence.\n    5. Return the operator and an empty dict, as this heuristic does not update or require any algorithm_data.\n    This ensures validity by only advancing schedulable jobs, respecting job operation sequences and avoiding re-finished operations.\n    The result is always valid for the construction phase, as AdvanceOperator only advances unfinished operations.\n\n    Args:\n        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:\n            - get_schedulable_jobs (callable): Returns list[int] of job IDs with remaining operations; used to identify candidates for random selection.\n        algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, no items are necessary or modified.\n\n    Returns:\n        AdvanceOperator: The operator instance for advancing the randomly selected job's next operation, or None if no schedulable jobs remain.\n        dict: Empty dictionary {}, as no updates to algorithm data are performed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Retrieve schedulable jobs without modifying problem_state\n    schedulable_jobs = problem_state['get_schedulable_jobs']()\n    \n    # Check if there are any schedulable jobs; if not, return None to indicate completion\n    if not schedulable_jobs:\n        return None, {}\n    \n    # Randomly select a job_id from the list\n    selected_job_id = random.choice(schedulable_jobs)\n    \n    # Create the AdvanceOperator for the selected job\n    operator = AdvanceOperator(selected_job_id)\n    \n    # Return operator and empty algorithm_data dict\n    return operator, {}"
