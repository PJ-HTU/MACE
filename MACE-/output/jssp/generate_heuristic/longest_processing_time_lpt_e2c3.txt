user
I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on jssp problem:
Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) involves scheduling a series of jobs, each comprising a sequence of operations, across different machines to optimize production efficiency. In this variant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between machines and operation types, ensuring that each operation is carried out by a specific machine. Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
A list of lists where each sublist represents the sequence of jobs scheduled on a machine, identified by its index in the outer list.
Each job is represented by its integer identifier and is processed in the order specified within the sublist.
Each sublist in 'job_sequences' corresponds to a machine's job processing sequence, with machines sorted by their identifier (index in the outer list).
Each job within a sublist is sorted by its scheduled order of execution on that machine.
Job matrix records the target operation(machine) sequence in job."""
    def __init__(self, job_sequences: list[list[int]], job_operation_sequence: list[list[int]], job_operation_index: list[int]):
        self.job_sequences = job_sequences
        self.job_operation_sequence = job_operation_sequence
        self.job_operation_index = job_operation_index
Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:
class AdvanceOperator(BaseOperator):
    """AdvanceOperator is responsible for advancing the next operation in the job's processing sequence.
This operator appends the next operation of the specified job to the processing queue of the machine that is scheduled to execute the operation.
It identifies the appropriate machine based on the job's current operation index and the job matrix within the provided Solution instance."""
    def __init__(self, job_id: int):
        self.job_id = job_id
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        new_job_sequences = [ops[:] for ops in solution.job_sequences]
        machine_id = solution.job_operation_sequence[self.job_id][solution.job_operation_index[self.job_id]]
        new_job_sequences[machine_id].append(self.job_id)
        job_operation_index = solution.job_operation_index
        job_operation_index[self.job_id] += 1
        return Solution(new_job_sequences, solution.job_operation_sequence, job_operation_index)

In pursuit of augmenting our heuristic algorithmic suite, we require the following standardized heuristic function signature:
def heuristic(problem_state: dict, algorithm_data: dict, **kwargs) -> tuple[TargetOperatorType, dict]:
The inputs are:
problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state with:
    - job_operation_sequence (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - job_operation_time (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - job_num (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - machine_num (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
    - current_solution (Solution): Current solution instance.
    - current_makespan (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - get_problem_state (callable): def get_problem_state(solution: Solution) -> dict: The function to get the complete problem state for given solution without modifying it. Returns a dictionary containing 'total_scheduling_cost' and other state information.
    - validation_solution (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution = None) -> bool: The function to check whether the solution is valid according to all mathematical model constraints. If solution is None, checks current solution. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.
    - get_schedulable_jobs (callable): def get_schedulable_jobs(solution: Solution = None) -> list[int]: Get list of job IDs that have remaining operations to schedule. A job is schedulable if its current operation index is less than the total number of operations in its sequence. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns list of integers representing schedulable job IDs.
    - get_next_operation_time (callable): def get_next_operation_time(job_id: int, solution: Solution = None) -> int: Get the processing time of the next unscheduled operation for a specific job. Uses the job's current operation index to retrieve the corresponding processing time from the job_operation_time matrix. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns integer representing the processing time of the next operation. Raises IndexError if the job has no remaining operations.
    - get_total_remaining_time (callable): def get_total_remaining_time(job_id: int, solution: Solution = None) -> int: Calculate the sum of processing times for all remaining unscheduled operations of a specific job. Considers all operations from the current operation index to the end of the job's sequence. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns integer representing the total remaining processing time for the job.
    - num_jobs (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - num_machines (int): The total number of machines in the problem.
    - avg_processing_time (float): The average processing time across all operations.
    - coeff_variation_processing_times (float): The coefficient of variation of processing times.
    - machine_load_variance (float): The variance of total processing times (loads) across machines.
    - max_processing_time (float): The maximum processing time among all operations.
    - scheduled_operations_ratio (float): Ratio of scheduled operations to total operations.
    - current_makespan (float): Maximum completion time among scheduled operations.
    - avg_machine_utilization (float): Average utilization across machines based on busy time over makespan.
    - remaining_workload (float): Total processing time of all unscheduled operations.
    - max_machine_queue_length (int): Maximum number of eligible unscheduled operations waiting for any machine.
    - critical_path_length (float): Length (time) of the longest path to a scheduled operation.
    - avg_operation_waiting_time (float): Average waiting time of scheduled operations beyond their job release.
algorithm_data(dict): Algorithm data contains the data that necessary for some algorithms.
Other hyper-parameters in kwargs.
The outputs includes the operator that must be an instance of a predefined target operator type and updated algorithm dict, which contains new information for future work for both this or other algorithm.

Yes, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decisions—such as sequencing operations on machines while respecting job precedence constraints and machine availability—to minimize objectives like makespan, which makes it inherently combinatorial. JSSP is NP-hard, so exact methods are impractical for large instances, and it's routinely solved using heuristics (e.g., dispatching rules like SPT or LPT), metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu search), and hyper-heuristics, which aligns well with your framework of selecting operators to build partial schedules incrementally.

Your Solution and Operator design appears sound for a constructive heuristic approach: the job_sequences represent machine-specific permutations (building the schedule disjunctively), job_operation_sequence captures the conjunctive (job-internal) order, and job_operation_index tracks progress per job. The AdvanceOperator effectively implements a selection heuristic by advancing a specific job's next operation to its machine queue, enabling priority-based dispatching. This setup supports hyper-heuristics by allowing the selection of which job to advance next based on the provided problem_state features (e.g., using remaining workload or machine loads for informed decisions). The heuristic signature you defined is appropriate for outputting a TargetOperatorType instance (like AdvanceOperator(job_id)) and updating algorithm_data for iterative improvement. If you're implementing specific rules (e.g., Apparent Tardiness Cost or Critical Path), ensure validation_solution checks for feasibility like no machine overlaps. Overall, this is a solid foundation for hyper-heuristic application to JSSP.

user
I need your help to design different 5 basic heuristics for the jssp problem.

## Heuristic Requirements:
1. **Constructive Nature**: Each heuristic must be constructive (or constructive followed by improvement), and build solutions step-by-step from scratch.

2. **Diversity**: The 5 heuristics should represent different strategies to ensure diversity in solution approaches.

The problem will work on following data.
Please try to understand the data and generate based on them, especially setting the default value for hyper-parameters:
All data is possible

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:

***heuristic:
Random Selection: Randomly selects one job from the list of schedulable jobs returned by get_schedulable_jobs() to advance its next operation. No hyperparameters required.
Shortest Processing Time (SPT): Selects the schedulable job with the smallest processing time for its next operation, obtained via get_next_operation_time(job_id). If ties, pick the lowest job ID. No hyperparameters.
Longest Processing Time (LPT): Selects the schedulable job with the largest processing time for its next operation, using get_next_operation_time(job_id). If ties, pick the lowest job ID. No hyperparameters.
Least Remaining Workload (LWR): Selects the schedulable job with the smallest total remaining processing time, computed by get_total_remaining_time(job_id). If ties, pick the lowest job ID. No hyperparameters.
Most Remaining Workload (MWR): Selects the schedulable job with the largest total remaining processing time, using get_total_remaining_time(job_id). If ties, pick the lowest job ID. No hyperparameters.
***

These heuristics are all purely constructive, iteratively selecting a job to advance via AdvanceOperator until all operations are scheduled (i.e., no schedulable jobs left). They leverage the provided callables in problem_state for efficiency without needing to recompute full states each time. Diversity comes from varying priorities: randomness for exploration, SPT/LPT for operation duration focus, and LWR/MWR for job-level workload balance. Each returns the operator instance and an unchanged algorithm_data dict (or minimally updated if tracking selections). For implementation, inside the function: fetch schedulable_jobs = problem_state['get_schedulable_jobs'](), then evaluate candidates based on the rule, select job_id, create AdvanceOperator(job_id), and return (operator, algorithm_data). If no schedulable jobs, you might want to handle termination, but assuming the caller manages the loop. These are basic dispatching rules adapted to your incremental operator framework, proven effective in JSSP literature for generating diverse initial solutions in hyper-heuristics.

Based on previous discuss, we get the heuristic Longest Processing Time (LPT):
 Selects the schedulable job with the largest processing time for its next operation, using get_next_operation_time(job_id). If ties, pick the lowest job ID. No hyperparameters..

Now please implement it in python function longest_processing_time_lpt_e2c3.

To implement this heuristic function in python, please note:
1. We can assume that Solution and all Operators are imported.
2. The operator type must be defined previously, do not create a new one in your code.
3. Never modify the data in problem_state.
4. All hyper parameters in kwargs should be set a default value.
5. Any reasonable partial solution may be used as input, such as an empty solution.
6. Comments in the code are very important. They must clearly explain which hyper-parameters are required by the algorithm (i.e., the parameters in **kwargs), how the algorithm proceeds, and under what circumstances it will not return any operator or will return an empty operator. We hope that people can understand the principles and workflow of the algorithm clearly just by reading the comments, without needing to look at the code.
7. The name of function must be longest_processing_time_lpt_e2c3. The TargetOperatorType should be replaced by real returned operator type.
8. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
9. For the algorithm to update the algorithm_data, do not modify directly "algorithm_data["abc"] = 123", we should return operator, {"abc": 123}.For algorithm that do not update them, just return operator, {}
10. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return None, {}.
11. Do not forget to check whether the content is empty when calculating the min/max/average/std/..., such as when using min([distance[node][other] for other in nodes if other != node]).
12. Make the result must be valid.
13. Do not forget the input problem_state:
problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state with:
    - job_operation_sequence (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - job_operation_time (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - job_num (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - machine_num (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
    - current_solution (Solution): Current solution instance.
    - current_makespan (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - get_problem_state (callable): def get_problem_state(solution: Solution) -> dict: The function to get the complete problem state for given solution without modifying it. Returns a dictionary containing 'total_scheduling_cost' and other state information.
    - validation_solution (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution = None) -> bool: The function to check whether the solution is valid according to all mathematical model constraints. If solution is None, checks current solution. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.
    - get_schedulable_jobs (callable): def get_schedulable_jobs(solution: Solution = None) -> list[int]: Get list of job IDs that have remaining operations to schedule. A job is schedulable if its current operation index is less than the total number of operations in its sequence. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns list of integers representing schedulable job IDs.
    - get_next_operation_time (callable): def get_next_operation_time(job_id: int, solution: Solution = None) -> int: Get the processing time of the next unscheduled operation for a specific job. Uses the job's current operation index to retrieve the corresponding processing time from the job_operation_time matrix. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns integer representing the processing time of the next operation. Raises IndexError if the job has no remaining operations.
    - get_total_remaining_time (callable): def get_total_remaining_time(job_id: int, solution: Solution = None) -> int: Calculate the sum of processing times for all remaining unscheduled operations of a specific job. Considers all operations from the current operation index to the end of the job's sequence. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns integer representing the total remaining processing time for the job.
    - num_jobs (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - num_machines (int): The total number of machines in the problem.
    - avg_processing_time (float): The average processing time across all operations.
    - coeff_variation_processing_times (float): The coefficient of variation of processing times.
    - machine_load_variance (float): The variance of total processing times (loads) across machines.
    - max_processing_time (float): The maximum processing time among all operations.
    - scheduled_operations_ratio (float): Ratio of scheduled operations to total operations.
    - current_makespan (float): Maximum completion time among scheduled operations.
    - avg_machine_utilization (float): Average utilization across machines based on busy time over makespan.
    - remaining_workload (float): Total processing time of all unscheduled operations.
    - max_machine_queue_length (int): Maximum number of eligible unscheduled operations waiting for any machine.
    - critical_path_length (float): Length (time) of the longest path to a scheduled operation.
    - avg_operation_waiting_time (float): Average waiting time of scheduled operations beyond their job release.

For jssp problem, take about following:
1. Make the result must be valid, such as: no re-finished operations.
2. As we consider that operations within a job need to be executed in sequence, to avoid unnecessary complications, we have provided only the AdvanceOperator during the construction phase, which simply requires specifying the job to advance it by one step.

The problem will work on following data.

    """
    Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic for JSSP.

    This constructive heuristic selects the schedulable job whose next operation has the longest processing time.
    It builds the solution incrementally by advancing one job at a time using the AdvanceOperator.
    The selection prioritizes jobs based on the processing time of their immediate next operation.
    In case of ties (multiple jobs with the same maximum processing time), the job with the lowest job ID is chosen.
    This heuristic aims to process longer operations earlier to potentially balance machine loads and reduce makespan.

    Hyperparameters:
    None required. All kwargs are ignored, with no default values needed since the algorithm is parameter-free.

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - get_schedulable_jobs (callable): Returns a list of job IDs that have remaining operations to schedule. Used to identify candidate jobs for selection.
            - get_next_operation_time (callable): Returns the processing time of the next unscheduled operation for a given job ID. Used to evaluate and compare processing times for schedulable jobs.
        algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, no items are necessary or modified; it is passed through unchanged.

    Returns:
        tuple[AdvanceOperator, dict]: Returns an AdvanceOperator instance for the selected job ID if schedulable jobs exist, along with an empty dict for updated algorithm data (no updates performed).
        If no schedulable jobs remain (all operations are scheduled), returns (None, {}) to indicate termination of construction.

    The algorithm proceeds as follows:
    1. Retrieve the list of schedulable job IDs using get_schedulable_jobs().
    2. If the list is empty, return (None, {}) as no further advancement is possible.
    3. For each schedulable job, compute the next operation's processing time using get_next_operation_time(job_id).
    4. Identify the job with the maximum processing time. If multiple jobs tie for the maximum, select the one with the lowest job ID.
    5. Create and return an AdvanceOperator for the selected job ID, which will append the job to the appropriate machine's sequence and increment the job's operation index.
    6. The returned operator ensures validity: it only advances schedulable jobs, preventing re-finished operations or violations of job sequencing constraints.
    No modifications are made to problem_state or algorithm_data directly; updates are returned separately.

***

This implementation strictly follows the LPT rule, ensuring validity by relying on the provided callables which respect JSSP constraints (e.g., only advancing jobs with remaining operations in sequence). The use of tuples with negated job_id for tie-breaking works efficiently without sorting the entire list. Comments in the docstring and inline explain the workflow, hyperparameters (none), necessary problem_state keys, and termination conditions clearly. No external libraries beyond the assumed import are needed, and problem_state is never modified. The function handles empty cases gracefully, returning None, {} when no action is possible, which allows the caller to detect completion.

***expected_result:(AdvanceOperator(job_id), {}) where job_id is the lowest-ID job among those with the maximum processing time for their first operation***

Given the empty initial solution, all 10 jobs are schedulable (get_schedulable_jobs() returns [0,1,...,9]). The function evaluates get_next_operation_time(job_id) for each, which fetches job_operation_time[job_id, 0] (first operation time, as job_operation_index[job_id]=0). It then selects the job_id maximizing that time, breaking ties by lowest job_id via the (time, -job_id) tuple maximization. Thus, the output is AdvanceOperator for that specific job_id (determined by the unseen job_operation_time matrix, e.g., if job 3 has the longest first op at 99 and no ties, job_id=3), paired with {}. It won't return None since schedulable_jobs is non-empty. This advances exactly one valid step without violating constraints, as AdvanceOperator only appends to the correct machine and increments the index.

The actual output AdvanceOperator(job_id=5) aligns perfectly with the expected behavior: it selected the job (in this case, job 5) whose first operation has the maximum processing time (99, as indicated by the updated makespan), and the tie-breaking rule would only come into play if multiple jobs had 99, choosing the lowest ID among them. Since the specific job_operation_time matrix isn't provided, job 5 being selected is consistent with the data-driven selection in the code. The solution update (appending to machine_1, assuming that's the machine for job 5's first op) and state changes (e.g., remaining_workload decreased by 99, scheduled_operations_ratio=0.01 for 1/100 ops) further validate correctness without any constraint violations. No fixes needed.

To ensure the stable of heuristics, we adjust the code to:
from src.problems.jssp.components import *

def longest_processing_time_lpt_e2c3(problem_state: dict, algorithm_data: dict, **kwargs) -> tuple[AdvanceOperator, dict]:
    """
    Longest Processing Time (LPT) heuristic for JSSP.

    This constructive heuristic selects the schedulable job whose next operation has the longest processing time.
    It builds the solution incrementally by advancing one job at a time using the AdvanceOperator.
    The selection prioritizes jobs based on the processing time of their immediate next operation.
    In case of ties (multiple jobs with the same maximum processing time), the job with the lowest job ID is chosen.
    This heuristic aims to process longer operations earlier to potentially balance machine loads and reduce makespan.

    Hyperparameters:
    None required. All kwargs are ignored, with no default values needed since the algorithm is parameter-free.

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - get_schedulable_jobs (callable): Returns a list of job IDs that have remaining operations to schedule. Used to identify candidate jobs for selection.
            - get_next_operation_time (callable): Returns the processing time of the next unscheduled operation for a given job ID. Used to evaluate and compare processing times for schedulable jobs.
        algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, no items are necessary or modified; it is passed through unchanged.

    Returns:
        tuple[AdvanceOperator, dict]: Returns an AdvanceOperator instance for the selected job ID if schedulable jobs exist, along with an empty dict for updated algorithm data (no updates performed).
        If no schedulable jobs remain (all operations are scheduled), returns (None, {}) to indicate termination of construction.

    The algorithm proceeds as follows:
    1. Retrieve the list of schedulable job IDs using get_schedulable_jobs().
    2. If the list is empty, return (None, {}) as no further advancement is possible.
    3. For each schedulable job, compute the next operation's processing time using get_next_operation_time(job_id).
    4. Identify the job with the maximum processing time. If multiple jobs tie for the maximum, select the one with the lowest job ID.
    5. Create and return an AdvanceOperator for the selected job ID, which will append the job to the appropriate machine's sequence and increment the job's operation index.
    6. The returned operator ensures validity: it only advances schedulable jobs, preventing re-finished operations or violations of job sequencing constraints.
    No modifications are made to problem_state or algorithm_data directly; updates are returned separately.
