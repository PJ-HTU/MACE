problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state with:
    - job_operation_sequence (numpy.ndarray): A list of jobs where each job is a list of operations in target sequence.
    - job_operation_time (numpy.ndarray): The time cost for each operation in target job.
    - job_num (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - machine_num (int): The total number of machines in the problem, also as operation num.
    - current_solution (Solution): Current solution instance.
    - current_makespan (int): The time cost for current operation jobs, also known as the current_makespan.
    - get_problem_state (callable): def get_problem_state(solution: Solution) -> dict: The function to get the complete problem state for given solution without modifying it. Returns a dictionary containing 'total_scheduling_cost' and other state information.
    - validation_solution (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution = None) -> bool: The function to check whether the solution is valid according to all mathematical model constraints. If solution is None, checks current solution. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.
    - get_schedulable_jobs (callable): def get_schedulable_jobs(solution: Solution = None) -> list[int]: Get list of job IDs that have remaining operations to schedule. A job is schedulable if its current operation index is less than the total number of operations in its sequence. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns list of integers representing schedulable job IDs.
    - get_next_operation_time (callable): def get_next_operation_time(job_id: int, solution: Solution = None) -> int: Get the processing time of the next unscheduled operation for a specific job. Uses the job's current operation index to retrieve the corresponding processing time from the job_operation_time matrix. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns integer representing the processing time of the next operation. Raises IndexError if the job has no remaining operations.
    - get_total_remaining_time (callable): def get_total_remaining_time(job_id: int, solution: Solution = None) -> int: Calculate the sum of processing times for all remaining unscheduled operations of a specific job. Considers all operations from the current operation index to the end of the job's sequence. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns integer representing the total remaining processing time for the job.
    - num_jobs (int): The total number of jobs in the problem.
    - num_machines (int): The total number of machines in the problem.
    - avg_processing_time (float): The average processing time across all operations.
    - coeff_variation_processing_times (float): The coefficient of variation of processing times.
    - machine_load_variance (float): The variance of total processing times (loads) across machines.
    - max_processing_time (float): The maximum processing time among all operations.
    - scheduled_operations_ratio (float): Ratio of scheduled operations to total operations.
    - current_makespan (float): Maximum completion time among scheduled operations.
    - avg_machine_utilization (float): Average utilization across machines based on busy time over makespan.
    - remaining_workload (float): Total processing time of all unscheduled operations.
    - max_machine_queue_length (int): Maximum number of eligible unscheduled operations waiting for any machine.
    - critical_path_length (float): Length (time) of the longest path to a scheduled operation.
    - avg_operation_waiting_time (float): Average waiting time of scheduled operations beyond their job release.
