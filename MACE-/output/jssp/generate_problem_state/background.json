Consequently, the number of operations (N) matches the number of machines, and each job includes these N operations precisely once.\n\n\nPlease consider is jssp a combinatorial operation problem and can be solved by heuristics?\nIf you think this problem is not a combinatorial operation problem or the solution, operator, data are incorrect, response ***is_cop:no*** to me, or response ***is_cop:yes***.\n\nThe response format is very important.

                "text": "***is_cop:yes***\n\nYes, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a well-established Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making to assign operations to machines while respecting precedence constraints and machine availability, typically aiming to minimize objectives like makespan. As an NP-hard problem, it's not solvable in polynomial time for large instances, making heuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search) and hyper-heuristics highly suitable and commonly applied approaches. Your description aligns with the standard formulation, including the one-to-one machine-operation correspondence and each job having exactly one operation per machine. If you're working on hyper-heuristics for JSSP, focusing on selection and generation of low-level heuristics for dispatching rules or neighborhood operators would be a strong direction."
