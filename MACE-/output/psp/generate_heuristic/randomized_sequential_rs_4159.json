The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.\n\nKey Problem Characteristics\n\nEach vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:\n1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth\n2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations\n3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth\n\nThe services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.\n\nMathematical Model Formulation\n\nDecision Variables\n- x_ijt \u2208 {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity C\u2c7c \u2265 vessel size S\u1d62)\n- y^in_ikt \u2208 {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t\n- y^out_ikt \u2208 {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t\n- z^in_it \u2208 {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t\n- z^out_it \u2208 {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t\n- u^early_i \u2265 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i\n- u^late_i \u2265 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i\n\nObjective Function\nMinimize: \u03bb\u2081Z\u2081 + \u03bb\u2082Z\u2082 + \u03bb\u2083Z\u2083 + \u03bb\u2084Z\u2084\n\nWhere:\n- Z\u2081 = \u03a3\u1d62 M\u00b7\u03b1\u1d62\u00b7(1 -

                "text": "***is_cop:yes***\n\nThe Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making\u2014such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.\n\nHeuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.\n\nPotential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics."

Diversity comes from prioritization (ETA, size, cost, random, priority/utilization), selection criteria (earliest, median/random, cost-min, balanced), and use of helpers like find_feasible_assignments for feasibility. Default hyperparameters: max_results=3 in find_feasible_assignments, up to 5 candidates in CMG, sample size=3 in RS; all leverage instance stats (e.g., avg_time_window_flex=mean(\u0394^early_i + \u0394^late_i)) for robustness. An improvement phase could follow each by re-running on unassigned vessels, but kept basic as per requirements.

This constructive heuristic builds a solution sequentially by processing unassigned vessels in a random order. It starts from the current partial solution and attempts to assign each vessel in the permuted order by sampling random inbound start times within the vessel's time window, checking resource availability for berths and tugboats, and using greedy tugboat combinations. It applies tight scheduling where berthing starts immediately after inbound service completion and outbound starts immediately after berthing. The first feasible assignment found across samples and compatible berths is selected. If no feasible assignment is found for a vessel, it explicitly unassigns it (redundant but as per design). The process is iterative across function calls: algorithm_data maintains the random permutation of unassigned vessels and the current processing index. If the permutation is exhausted or there are no unassigned vessels, no operator is returned.\n\n    This heuristic is diversity-oriented, relying on randomization for exploration, and ensures validity by checking availability constraints before proposing an assignment. It considers partial solutions as input, only targeting currently unassigned vessels. Costs are implicitly handled via feasibility (unserved penalties apply if unassigned; other costs via calculate_assignment_cost if needed, but here focused on feasibility).

Each function call handles one vessel from the random sequence, returning an appropriate operator to advance the partial solution toward completeness. The code ensures no modifications to problem_state, uses defaults for hyperparameters, and handles edge cases like empty unassigned lists or invalid time windows. Validity is enforced through the helper functions' checks, which cover all mathematical constraints (e.g., availability includes preparation times, combinations meet HP requirements, tight timing satisfies sequence constraints within epsilon). If needed, an optional post-operator validation via validation_solution could be added, but it's omitted for efficiency as the checks are comprehensive. The algorithm_data enables stateful sequential building without regenerating the full permutation unnecessarily, promoting efficiency in repeated calls. For costs, while not explicitly computed here (focus on feasibility for constructive step), the returned assignment would integrate into total_scheduling_cost upon application, including all Z1-Z4 components."

This constructive heuristic builds a solution sequentially by processing unassigned vessels in a random order. It starts from the current partial solution and attempts to assign each vessel in the permuted order by sampling random inbound start times within the vessel's time window, checking resource availability for berths and tugboats, and using greedy tugboat combinations. It applies tight scheduling where berthing starts immediately after inbound service completion and outbound starts immediately after berthing. The first feasible assignment found across samples and compatible berths is selected. If no feasible assignment is found for a vessel, it explicitly unassigns it (redundant but as per design). The process is iterative across function calls: algorithm_data maintains the random permutation of unassigned vessels and the current processing index. If the permutation is exhausted or there are no unassigned vessels, no operator is returned.\n\n    This heuristic is diversity-oriented, relying on randomization for exploration, and ensures validity by checking availability constraints before proposing an assignment.

empty dict if no update needed.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Extract necessary components from problem_state (never modify problem_state)\n    current_solution = problem_state['current_solution']\n    get_unassigned_vessels = problem_state['get_unassigned_vessels']\n    get_vessel_time_window = problem_state['get_vessel_time_window']\n    get_compatible_berths = problem_state['get_compatible_berths']\n    is_berth_available = problem_state['is_berth_available']\n    is_tugboat_available = problem_state['is_tugboat_available']\n    find_tugboat_combination = problem_state['find_tugboat_combination']\n    vessel_sizes = problem_state['vessel_sizes']\n    vessel_durations = problem_state['vessel_durations']\n    vessel_inbound_service_times = problem_state['vessel_inbound_service_times']\n    vessel_outbound_service_times = problem_state['vessel_outbound_service_times']\n    vessel_horsepower_requirements = problem_state['vessel_horsepower_requirements']\n    inbound_preparation_time = problem_state['inbound_preparation_time']\n    outbound_preparation_time = problem_state['outbound_preparation_time']\n    time_constraint_tolerance = problem_state['time_constraint_tolerance']\n\n    # Hyper-parameter with default\n    sample_size = kwargs.get('sample_size', 3)\n\n    # Get current unassigned vessels\n    unassigned_vessels = get_unassigned_vessels(current_solution)\n    if not unassigned_vessels:\n        # No vessels to assign;
