The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.\n\nKey Problem Characteristics\n\nEach vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:\n1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth\n2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations\n3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth\n\nThe services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.\n\nMathematical Model Formulation\n\nDecision Variables\n- x_ijt \u2208 {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity C\u2c7c \u2265 vessel size S\u1d62)\n- y^in_ikt \u2208 {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t\n- y^out_ikt \u2208 {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t\n- z^in_it \u2208 {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t\n- z^out_it \u2208 {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t\n- u^early_i \u2265 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i\n- u^late_i \u2265 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i\n\nObjective Function\nMinimize: \u03bb\u2081Z\u2081 + \u03bb\u2082Z\u2082 + \u03bb\u2083Z\u2083 + \u03bb\u2084Z\u2084\n\nWhere:\n- Z\u2081 = \u03a3\u1d62 M\u00b7\u03b1\u1d62\u00b7(1 -

                "text": "***is_cop:yes***\n\nThe Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making\u2014such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.\n\nHeuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.\n\nPotential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics."

This constructive heuristic builds upon a partial solution by prioritizing the largest unassigned vessel (by vessel size S_i) and attempting to assign it to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization. The assignment uses tight scheduling centered on the median of the vessel's inbound time window, with inbound tugboat service starting at the median time, berthing immediately after inbound completion, and outbound tugboat service immediately after berthing completion. Tugboat combinations are found using greedy selection, and availability is verified for berths and all selected tugboats. If a feasible assignment is found for the prioritized vessel, a CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator is returned to apply the assignment; otherwise, None is returned if no unassigned vessels remain or no feasible assignment exists for the largest unassigned vessel.

Tight scheduling minimizes deviations, and all checks (availability, combinations) guarantee the returned operator produces a valid extension (no local violations; global validation can be done post-application via validation_solution). Hyper-parameters are optional with sensible defaults for efficiency. If unassigned vessels exist but the largest cannot be assigned (e.g., due to resource constraints), it returns None to allow other heuristics to proceed, preventing stalls. No algorithm_data updates are needed, as the heuristic is stateless beyond the solution. Costs are implicitly considered via feasibility (unserved penalties avoided when possible), but explicit cost calculation is omitted here since the focus is assignment; calculate_assignment_cost could be added post-assignment if needed. The code handles empty lists/arrays safely (e.g., no min/max on empty)."

This constructive heuristic builds upon a partial solution by prioritizing the largest unassigned vessel (by vessel size S_i) and attempting to assign it to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization. The assignment uses tight scheduling centered on the median of the vessel's inbound time window, with inbound tugboat service starting at the median time, berthing immediately after inbound completion, and outbound tugboat service immediately after berthing completion. Tugboat combinations are found using greedy selection, and availability is verified for berths and all selected tugboats. If a feasible assignment is found for the prioritized vessel, a CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator is returned to apply the assignment; otherwise, None is returned if no unassigned vessels remain or no feasible assignment exists for the largest unassigned vessel.

To fix this, I added safe checks before unpacking: verify that the result is a tuple of length 2 and that the first element (tugboat list) is not `None`. If not, skip to the next berth. This handles potential implementation discrepancies in the helper function without altering its expected behavior.\n\nAdditionally, I fixed a minor issue in the utilization calculation loop: changed `for vid, (bid, bstart) in current_solution.vessel_assignments.items():` to `for vid, assignment in current_solution.vessel_assignments.items(): if assignment is not None: bid, _ = assignment`, as the description indicates `None` for unassigned vessels, ensuring no unpacking error if somehow an unassigned entry has `None`.\n\nThese changes prevent crashes during smoke tests with constrained resources (e.g., insufficient total HP), allowing the heuristic to gracefully skip infeasible cases and return `(None, {})` when no assignment is possible for the largest vessel. The code remains faithful to the LVF strategy and ensures partial solutions are extended validly when feasible."

Given the stats (total_available_hp=80275, but per-vessel HP not specified\u2014assuming avg ~3461 per vessel, feasible for one), and short eta_span=15 with avg flex=3.7, it's likely to return an operator for vessel argmax(S_i), with tight scheduling around its ETA. The partial_objective_value=110130.77 suggests pre-computed unserved penalties (100 * penalty * avg alpha?), which would decrease post-assignment. If the test crashes or returns None unexpectedly, it indicates issues with helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination failing on empty) or data (e.g., time_periods too small)."

This constructive heuristic builds upon a partial solution by prioritizing the largest unassigned vessel (by vessel size S_i) and attempting to assign it to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization.

Tugboat combinations are found using greedy selection, and availability is verified for berths and all selected tugboats.
