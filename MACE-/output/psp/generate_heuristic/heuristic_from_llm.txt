I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on psp problem:
Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) - Mathematical Model Description

Problem Overview

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) involves optimal allocation of vessels to berths with coordinated tugboat services. The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.

Key Problem Characteristics

Each vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:
1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth
2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations
3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth

The services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.

Mathematical Model Formulation

Decision Variables
- x_ijt ∈ {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity Cⱼ ≥ vessel size Sᵢ)
- y^in_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t
- y^out_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t
- z^in_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t
- z^out_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t
- u^early_i ≥ 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i
- u^late_i ≥ 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i

Objective Function
Minimize: λ₁Z₁ + λ₂Z₂ + λ₃Z₃ + λ₄Z₄

Where:
- Z₁ = Σᵢ M·αᵢ·(1 - Σⱼ Σₜ x_ijt) [Unserved vessel penalty]
- Z₂ = Σᵢ αᵢ·βᵢ·[Σₜ (t + τ^out_i)·z^out_it - Σₜ t·z^in_it] [Total port time cost]
- Z₃ = Σᵢ αᵢ·γᵢ·(u^early_i + u^late_i) [ETA deviation cost]
- Z₄ = Σₖ Σᵢ Σₜ cₖ·(τ^in_i·y^in_ikt + τ^out_i·y^out_ikt) [Tugboat utilization cost]

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of Port Scheduling Problem supporting multi-tugboat services.
Attributes:
    vessel_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to (berth_id, start_time) tuple. None if vessel is unassigned.
    tugboat_inbound_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to list of tuple (tugboat_id, start_time) for inbound service.
    tugboat_outbound_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to list of tuple (tugboat_id, start_time) for outbound service."""
    def __init__(self, vessel_assignments: dict=None, tugboat_inbound_assignments: dict=None, tugboat_outbound_assignments: dict=None):

Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

***is_cop:yes***

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making—such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.

Heuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.

Potential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics.

## Heuristic Requirements:
1. **Constructive Nature**: Each heuristic must be constructive (or constructive followed by improvement), and build solutions step-by-step from scratch.

2. **Diversity**: The 5 heuristics should represent different strategies to ensure diversity in solution approaches.

The problem will work on following data.

***heuristic:
Earliest Arrival First (EAF): Sort unassigned vessels by increasing ETA; for each vessel in order, use find_feasible_assignments to select the earliest available assignment within its time window, preferring the compatible berth with highest remaining capacity; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to add the assignment if feasible, tracking total cost.
Largest Vessel First (LVF): Prioritize unassigned vessels by decreasing vessel size (S_i); for each, identify compatible berths via get_compatible_berths, then use find_tugboat_combination for inbound/outbound at the median of the vessel's time window; assign to the berth with lowest current utilization using is_berth_available, applying the operator only if all resources (tugboats via is_tugboat_available) are free.
Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG): Iterate over unassigned vessels in random order; for each, generate up to 5 candidate assignments via find_feasible_assignments, compute costs with calculate_assignment_cost, and select the one with minimal marginal cost increase to total_scheduling_cost; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for the best, updating solution statistics.
Randomized Sequential (RS): Randomly permute all vessel IDs; sequentially attempt assignments starting from an empty solution; for each vessel, sample 3 random start times within get_vessel_time_window, check berth/tugboat availability, and use find_tugboat_combination; apply operator for the first feasible option found, defaulting to unassign if none.
Utilization-Balanced (UB): Sort vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i); for each, select the compatible berth with the lowest current utilization (from berth_utilization stat); center the start time on ETA, adjust by up to avg_time_window_flex to fit availability; find tugboat combos minimizing tug_utilization impact, apply operator if validation_solution passes post-assignment.
***

These heuristics are designed to be constructive, starting from an empty solution (all vessels unassigned) and iteratively building by applying CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator (or UnassignVesselOperator implicitly for failures). Diversity comes from prioritization (ETA, size, cost, random, priority/utilization), selection criteria (earliest, median/random, cost-min, balanced), and use of helpers like find_feasible_assignments for feasibility. Default hyperparameters: max_results=3 in find_feasible_assignments, up to 5 candidates in CMG, sample size=3 in RS; all leverage instance stats (e.g., avg_time_window_flex=mean(Δ^early_i + Δ^late_i)) for robustness. An improvement phase could follow each by re-running on unassigned vessels, but kept basic as per requirements. For implementation, TargetOperatorType would be CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or UnassignVesselOperator, with algorithm_data updated to include iteration count or partial costs.
