The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.\n\nKey Problem Characteristics\n\nEach vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:\n1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth\n2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations\n3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth\n\nThe services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.\n\nMathematical Model Formulation\n\nDecision Variables\n- x_ijt \u2208 {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity C\u2c7c \u2265 vessel size S\u1d62)\n- y^in_ikt \u2208 {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t\n- y^out_ikt \u2208 {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t\n- z^in_it \u2208 {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t\n- z^out_it \u2208 {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t\n- u^early_i \u2265 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i\n- u^late_i \u2265 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i\n\nObjective Function\nMinimize: \u03bb\u2081Z\u2081 + \u03bb\u2082Z\u2082 + \u03bb\u2083Z\u2083 + \u03bb\u2084Z\u2084\n\nWhere:\n- Z\u2081 = \u03a3\u1d62 M\u00b7\u03b1\u1d62\u00b7(1 -

                "text": "***is_cop:yes***\n\nThe Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making\u2014such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.\n\nHeuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.\n\nPotential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics."

Diversity comes from prioritization (ETA, size, cost, random, priority/utilization), selection criteria (earliest, median/random, cost-min, balanced), and use of helpers like find_feasible_assignments for feasibility. Default hyperparameters: max_results=3 in find_feasible_assignments, up to 5 candidates in CMG, sample size=3 in RS; all leverage instance stats (e.g., avg_time_window_flex=mean(\u0394^early_i + \u0394^late_i)) for robustness. An improvement phase could follow each by re-running on unassigned vessels, but kept basic as per requirements. For implementation, TargetOperatorType would be CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or UnassignVesselOperator, with algorithm_data updated to include iteration count or partial costs."
