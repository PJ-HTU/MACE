I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on psp problem:
Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) - Mathematical Model Description

Problem Overview

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) involves optimal allocation of vessels to berths with coordinated tugboat services. The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.

Key Problem Characteristics

Each vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:
1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth
2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations
3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth

The services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.

Mathematical Model Formulation

Decision Variables
- x_ijt ∈ {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity Cⱼ ≥ vessel size Sᵢ)
- y^in_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t
- y^out_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t
- z^in_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t
- z^out_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t
- u^early_i ≥ 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i
- u^late_i ≥ 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i

Objective Function
Minimize: λ₁Z₁ + λ₂Z₂ + λ₃Z₃ + λ₄Z₄

Where:
- Z₁ = Σᵢ M·αᵢ·(1 - Σⱼ Σₜ x_ijt) [Unserved vessel penalty]
- Z₂ = Σᵢ αᵢ·βᵢ·[Σₜ (t + τ^out_i)·z^out_it - Σₜ t·z^in_it] [Total port time cost]
- Z₃ = Σᵢ αᵢ·γᵢ·(u^early_i + u^late_i) [ETA deviation cost]
- Z₄ = Σₖ Σᵢ Σₜ cₖ·(τ^in_i·y^in_ikt + τ^out_i·y^out_ikt) [Tugboat utilization cost]

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of Port Scheduling Problem supporting multi-tugboat services.

    vessel_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to (berth_id, start_time) tuple. None if vessel is unassigned.
    tugboat_inbound_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to list of tuple (tugboat_id, start_time) for inbound service.

Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

***is_cop:yes***

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making—such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.

Heuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.

Potential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics.

## Heuristic Requirements:

2. **Diversity**: The 5 heuristics should represent different strategies to ensure diversity in solution approaches.

The problem will work on following data.

***heuristic:
Earliest Arrival First (EAF): Sort unassigned vessels by increasing ETA; for each vessel in order, use find_feasible_assignments to select the earliest available assignment within its time window, preferring the compatible berth with highest remaining capacity; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to add the assignment if feasible, tracking total cost.
Largest Vessel First (LVF): Prioritize unassigned vessels by decreasing vessel size (S_i); for each, identify compatible berths via get_compatible_berths, then use find_tugboat_combination for inbound/outbound at the median of the vessel's time window; assign to the berth with lowest current utilization using is_berth_available, applying the operator only if all resources (tugboats via is_tugboat_available) are free.
Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG): Iterate over unassigned vessels in random order; for each, generate up to 5 candidate assignments via find_feasible_assignments, compute costs with calculate_assignment_cost, and select the one with minimal marginal cost increase to total_scheduling_cost; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for the best, updating solution statistics.
Randomized Sequential (RS): Randomly permute all vessel IDs; sequentially attempt assignments starting from an empty solution; for each vessel, sample 3 random start times within get_vessel_time_window, check berth/tugboat availability, and use find_tugboat_combination; apply operator for the first feasible option found, defaulting to unassign if none.
Utilization-Balanced (UB): Sort vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i); for each, select the compatible berth with the lowest current utilization (from berth_utilization stat); center the start time on ETA, adjust by up to avg_time_window_flex to fit availability; find tugboat combos minimizing tug_utilization impact, apply operator if validation_solution passes post-assignment.
***

These heuristics are designed to be constructive, starting from an empty solution (all vessels unassigned) and iteratively building by applying CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator (or UnassignVesselOperator implicitly for failures). Diversity comes from prioritization (ETA, size, cost, random, priority/utilization), selection criteria (earliest, median/random, cost-min, balanced), and use of helpers like find_feasible_assignments for feasibility. Default hyperparameters: max_results=3 in find_feasible_assignments, up to 5 candidates in CMG, sample size=3 in RS; all leverage instance stats (e.g., avg_time_window_flex=mean(Δ^early_i + Δ^late_i)) for robustness. An improvement phase could follow each by re-running on unassigned vessels, but kept basic as per requirements. For implementation, TargetOperatorType would be CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or UnassignVesselOperator, with algorithm_data updated to include iteration count or partial costs.

Based on previous discuss, we get the heuristic Earliest Arrival First (EAF):
 Sort unassigned vessels by increasing ETA; for each vessel in order, use find_feasible_assignments to select the earliest available assignment within its time window, preferring the compatible berth with highest remaining capacity; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to add the assignment if feasible, tracking total cost..

Now please implement it in python function earliest_arrival_first_eaf_4fe1.

To implement this heuristic function in python, please note:
1. We can assume that Solution and all Operators are imported.
2. The operator type must be defined previously, do not create a new one in your code.
3. Never modify the data in problem_state.
4. All hyper parameters in kwargs should be set a default value.
5. Any reasonable partial solution may be used as input, such as an empty solution.
6. Comments in the code are very important. They must clearly explain which hyper-parameters are required by the algorithm (i.e., the parameters in **kwargs), how the algorithm proceeds, and under what circumstances it will not return any operator or will return an empty operator. We hope that people can understand the principles and workflow of the algorithm clearly just by reading the comments, without needing to look at the code.
7. The name of function must be earliest_arrival_first_eaf_4fe1. The TargetOperatorType should be replaced by real returned operator type.
8. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
9. For the algorithm to update the algorithm_data, do not modify directly "algorithm_data["abc"] = 123", we should return operator, {"abc": 123}.For algorithm that do not update them, just return operator, {}
10. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return None, {}.
11. Do not forget to check whether the content is empty when calculating the min/max/average/std/..., such as when using min([distance[node][other] for other in nodes if other != node]).
12. Make the result must be valid.
13. Do not forget the input problem_state:
problem_state (dict): A dictionary containing the problem state information, organized into five categories of keys:

***
The implementation focuses on assigning one vessel per call—the earliest unassigned by ETA—to support iterative hyper-heuristic application on partial solutions. It computes remaining berth capacity as unused time slots (time_periods - sum of assigned durations per berth), assuming non-overlapping assignments (enforced by is_berth_available in helpers). This ensures validity as find_feasible_assignments handles all constraints (timing, resources, horsepower), and the operator applies only feasible complete services. If the current solution is empty, it starts assigning from scratch. No algorithm_data updates are needed, as solution stats are handled externally. Hyperparameter max_candidates defaults to 5 for balance; adjust higher for denser instances using vessel_arrival_density stat if extended. The code avoids modifying problem_state and uses safe checks for empty lists/sets.

***expected_result:A CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator instance assigning the unassigned vessel with the smallest ETA (likely vessel ID 0 or the one with min(vessel_etas)) to a compatible berth (selected by earliest start_time and highest remaining capacity, which is full for all initially) at a start_time near that vessel's ETA (from find_feasible_assignments candidates, e.g., ETA or ETA±1), with inbound_tugboats as a list of 1+ (tugboat_id, inbound_start_time) tuples meeting horsepower requirements via greedy/exhaustive search, and outbound_tugboats similarly for outbound service post-berthing; all times synchronized per service. If the vessel's P^req_i exceeds total_available_hp (80275) or no combo fits within H_max and availability, returns None, {}. Updated algorithm_data: empty dict {}.***

Given the empty initial solution (all resources free), the heuristic should succeed in assigning the earliest vessel unless its individual requirements can't be met (e.g., P^req_i > sum(tugboat_horsepower) or incompatible with all berths), which is unlikely for the first assignment despite overall HP shortage. The partial_objective_value (110130.77) likely reflects the baseline unserved penalty (λ₁ * M * sum(α_i) for all 100 vessels), and post-assignment, it would decrease by the penalty saved minus added Z2/Z3/Z4 costs. The operator ensures validity per constraints, as helpers enforce them. In a smoke test, expect the operator to have non-empty tugboat lists with same start times per service.

Please compare with your expected result: A CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator instance assigning the unassigned vessel with the smallest ETA (likely vessel ID 0 or the one with min(vessel_etas)) to a compatible berth (selected by earliest start_time and highest remaining capacity, which is full for all initially) at a start_time near that vessel's ETA (from find_feasible_assignments candidates, e.g., ETA or ETA±1), with inbound_tugboats as a list of 1+ (tugboat_id, inbound_start_time) tuples meeting horsepower requirements via greedy/exhaustive search, and outbound_tugboats similarly for outbound service post-berthing; all times synchronized per service. If the vessel's P^req_i exceeds total_available_hp (80275) or no combo fits within H_max and availability, returns None, {}. Updated algorithm_data: empty dict {}.

The output aligns well with the expected behavior: vessel 23 was selected as it has the smallest ETA in the test data (vessel IDs don't imply ETA order), assigned to berth 0 (first compatible, full capacity) at an early start_time=2 near its ETA (inbound at 1, tight sequencing to outbound at 5 post-berthing), using a single tugboat 8 (meets HP via greedy in find_tugboat_combination, available since empty solution). Times are synchronized per service, and stats updated correctly (e.g., cost decrease by ~1247, likely α_23 * (M - Z2-Z3-Z4 for this assignment), fraction 0.01). No issues; the "likely ID 0" was illustrative, not literal. The code's logic holds, ensuring validity per helpers.

To ensure the stable of heuristics, we adjust the code to:
from src.problems.psp.components import *
import numpy as np

def earliest_arrival_first_eaf_4fe1(problem_state: dict, algorithm_data: dict, **kwargs) -> tuple[CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator, dict]:
    """
    Earliest Arrival First (EAF) heuristic: Selects the unassigned vessel with the smallest ETA and attempts to assign it to the earliest feasible berth-time slot within its time window, preferring berths with the highest remaining capacity (time_periods - current occupied duration). Uses find_feasible_assignments to generate candidate assignments and selects the best one based on earliest start_time and then highest remaining capacity. Returns a CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for this assignment if feasible; otherwise, returns None if no unassigned vessels remain or no feasible assignment exists for the selected vessel. This enables step-by-step construction on partial solutions by iteratively assigning one vessel per heuristic call.

    Hyperparameters (in kwargs, with defaults):
    - max_candidates (int, default=5): Maximum number of candidate assignments to generate via find_feasible_assignments for the selected vessel. Higher values increase search thoroughness but computational cost.

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - current_solution (Solution): Current partial solution to extend.
            - total_scheduling_cost (float): Current total cost (used for tracking but not modified here).
            - vessel_num (int): Total number of vessels.
            - time_periods (int): Total scheduling horizon for remaining capacity calculation.
            - vessel_etas (numpy.ndarray): ETAs for sorting unassigned vessels.
            - vessel_durations (numpy.ndarray): Berthing durations for occupied time computation.
            - vessel_sizes (numpy.ndarray): Vessel sizes for compatibility (used indirectly via helpers).
            - berth_capacities (numpy.ndarray): Berth capacities for preference in ties (used if needed).
            - get_unassigned_vessels (callable): To retrieve list of unassigned vessel IDs.
            - find_feasible_assignments (callable): To generate feasible assignment candidates for the vessel.
        algorithm_data (dict): Not used in this algorithm; returned as empty dict.
        **kwargs: Hyperparameters as described above.

    Returns:
        CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or None: Operator to assign the selected vessel if a feasible assignment is found; None otherwise (no action if all vessels assigned or no feasible slot).
        dict: Empty dict as no algorithm data is updated by this heuristic.
