I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on psp problem:
Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) - Mathematical Model Description

Problem Overview

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) involves optimal allocation of vessels to berths with coordinated tugboat services. The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.

Key Problem Characteristics

Each vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:
1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth
2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations
3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth

The services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.

Mathematical Model Formulation

Decision Variables
- x_ijt ∈ {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity Cⱼ ≥ vessel size Sᵢ)
- y^in_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t
- y^out_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t
- z^in_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t
- z^out_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t
- u^early_i ≥ 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i
- u^late_i ≥ 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i

Objective Function
Minimize: λ₁Z₁ + λ₂Z₂ + λ₃Z₃ + λ₄Z₄

Where:
- Z₁ = Σᵢ M·αᵢ·(1 - Σⱼ Σₜ x_ijt) [Unserved vessel penalty]
- Z₂ = Σᵢ αᵢ·βᵢ·[Σₜ (t + τ^out_i)·z^out_it - Σₜ t·z^in_it] [Total port time cost]
- Z₃ = Σᵢ αᵢ·γᵢ·(u^early_i + u^late_i) [ETA deviation cost]
- Z₄ = Σₖ Σᵢ Σₜ cₖ·(τ^in_i·y^in_ikt + τ^out_i·y^out_ikt) [Tugboat utilization cost]

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of Port Scheduling Problem supporting multi-tugboat services.

    vessel_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to (berth_id, start_time) tuple. None if vessel is unassigned.
    tugboat_inbound_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to list of tuple (tugboat_id, start_time) for inbound service.

Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

***is_cop:yes***

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making—such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.

Heuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.

Potential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics.

I need your help to design different 5 basic heuristics for the psp problem.

## Heuristic Requirements:

2. **Diversity**: The 5 heuristics should represent different strategies to ensure diversity in solution approaches.

The problem will work on following data.

***heuristic:
Earliest Arrival First (EAF): Sort unassigned vessels by increasing ETA; for each vessel in order, use find_feasible_assignments to select the earliest available assignment within its time window, preferring the compatible berth with highest remaining capacity; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to add the assignment if feasible, tracking total cost.
Largest Vessel First (LVF): Prioritize unassigned vessels by decreasing vessel size (S_i); for each, identify compatible berths via get_compatible_berths, then use find_tugboat_combination for inbound/outbound at the median of the vessel's time window; assign to the berth with lowest current utilization using is_berth_available, applying the operator only if all resources (tugboats via is_tugboat_available) are free.
Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG): Iterate over unassigned vessels in random order; for each, generate up to 5 candidate assignments via find_feasible_assignments, compute costs with calculate_assignment_cost, and select the one with minimal marginal cost increase to total_scheduling_cost; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for the best, updating solution statistics.
Randomized Sequential (RS): Randomly permute all vessel IDs; sequentially attempt assignments starting from an empty solution; for each vessel, sample 3 random start times within get_vessel_time_window, check berth/tugboat availability, and use find_tugboat_combination; apply operator for the first feasible option found, defaulting to unassign if none.
Utilization-Balanced (UB): Sort vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i); for each, select the compatible berth with the lowest current utilization (from berth_utilization stat); center the start time on ETA, adjust by up to avg_time_window_flex to fit availability; find tugboat combos minimizing tug_utilization impact, apply operator if validation_solution passes post-assignment.
***

These heuristics are designed to be constructive, starting from an empty solution (all vessels unassigned) and iteratively building by applying CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator (or UnassignVesselOperator implicitly for failures). Diversity comes from prioritization (ETA, size, cost, random, priority/utilization), selection criteria (earliest, median/random, cost-min, balanced), and use of helpers like find_feasible_assignments for feasibility. Default hyperparameters: max_results=3 in find_feasible_assignments, up to 5 candidates in CMG, sample size=3 in RS; all leverage instance stats (e.g., avg_time_window_flex=mean(Δ^early_i + Δ^late_i)) for robustness. An improvement phase could follow each by re-running on unassigned vessels, but kept basic as per requirements. For implementation, TargetOperatorType would be CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or UnassignVesselOperator, with algorithm_data updated to include iteration count or partial costs.

Based on previous discuss, we get the heuristic Utilization-Balanced (UB):
 Sort vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i); for each, select the compatible berth with the lowest current utilization (from berth_utilization stat); center the start time on ETA, adjust by up to avg_time_window_flex to fit availability; find tugboat combos minimizing tug_utilization impact, apply operator if validation_solution passes post-assignment..

Now please implement it in python function utilization_balanced_ub_eb0a.

To implement this heuristic function in python, please note:
1. We can assume that Solution and all Operators are imported.
2. The operator type must be defined previously, do not create a new one in your code.
3. Never modify the data in problem_state.
4. All hyper parameters in kwargs should be set a default value.
5. Any reasonable partial solution may be used as input, such as an empty solution.
6. Comments in the code are very important. They must clearly explain which hyper-parameters are required by the algorithm (i.e., the parameters in **kwargs), how the algorithm proceeds, and under what circumstances it will not return any operator or will return an empty operator. We hope that people can understand the principles and workflow of the algorithm clearly just by reading the comments, without needing to look at the code.
7. The name of function must be utilization_balanced_ub_eb0a. The TargetOperatorType should be replaced by real returned operator type.
8. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
9. For the algorithm to update the algorithm_data, do not modify directly "algorithm_data["abc"] = 123", we should return operator, {"abc": 123}.For algorithm that do not update them, just return operator, {}
10. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return None, {}.
11. Do not forget to check whether the content is empty when calculating the min/max/average/std/..., such as when using min([distance[node][other] for other in nodes if other != node]).
12. Make the result must be valid.
13. Do not forget the input problem_state:
problem_state (dict): A dictionary containing the problem state information, organized into five categories of keys:

    """
    Utilization-Balanced (UB) Heuristic: A constructive heuristic that prioritizes unassigned vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i) and attempts to assign the highest-priority vessel to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization. The inbound service start time is centered on the vessel's ETA and adjusted within the average time window flexibility to find a feasible slot. Tugboat combinations are found using the provided helper to minimize the number of tugs (indirectly balancing utilization by efficiency), with availability checks ensuring no conflicts. The assignment is applied only if the post-assignment solution validates fully. This heuristic builds incrementally on partial solutions by assigning one vessel per invocation, promoting balanced resource use across berths and tugs.

This implementation follows the UB heuristic precisely: prioritizes by α_i, selects lowest-util berth (computed dynamically), centers on ETA with flex-based adjustments (default max_adjust=5 steps), uses find_tugboat_combination for efficient (minimal tugs) combos while enforcing low-util threshold on selected tugs (to minimize impact), and validates fully post-assignment. It handles partial solutions by building on current_solution, processes one vessel per call for iterative use in hyper-heuristics, and considers all objective components implicitly via validation (which checks constraints tied to Z1-Z4). If time_periods=0, utils=0 to avoid div/0. Costs aren't explicitly recalculated here (validation ensures validity, and total_scheduling_cost can be updated externally), but feasibility includes timing/ETA/penalty aspects. For empty unassigned or no compatibles, returns None,{}. The tug selection balances by avoiding high-util tugs and minimal count.

    """
    Utilization-Balanced (UB) Heuristic: A constructive heuristic that prioritizes unassigned vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i) and attempts to assign the highest-priority vessel to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization. The inbound service start time is centered on the vessel's ETA and adjusted within the average time window flexibility to find a feasible slot. Tugboat combinations are found using the provided helper to minimize the number of tugs (indirectly balancing utilization by efficiency), with availability checks ensuring no conflicts. The assignment is applied only if the post-assignment solution validates fully.

***

The error was caused by attempting to call `len(inbound_tugs)` when `inbound_tugs` was `None` (returned by `find_tugboat_combination` if no valid combination found), as the `or` operator does not short-circuit in a way that prevents the evaluation of the second condition when the first is falsy. To fix this, I changed the unpacking to assign the full result tuple first (e.g., `inbound_result = find_tugboat_combination(...)`) and then extract `inbound_tugs = inbound_result[0] if inbound_result else None`, ensuring safe handling. The condition `if inbound_tugs is None or len(inbound_tugs) > max_tugboats_per_service:` now explicitly checks `is None` first, which short-circuits the `or` properly since `is None` (True) skips the `len()` call. The same fix applies to the outbound combination. This prevents the TypeError while maintaining the logic. The rest of the code remains unchanged, as it handles partial solutions, validates fully (covering all Z1-Z4 via constraints), and returns valid results or None appropriately. With the test data's tight constraints (e.g., high HP demand vs. availability), it may often return None, but won't crash.

The persistent error suggests that `get_vessel_time_window(vessel_id)` is returning `None` instead of a tuple in the test environment, causing the unpacking `earliest_inbound, latest_inbound = time_window` to fail with "cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object". This could occur if the vessel's early/late limits make the window invalid (e.g., negative flexibility or data anomalies in the high-density test case). To fix, I've added a robust check immediately after fetching `time_window`: if it's `None` or not a valid 2-element iterable, or if `earliest > latest`, return `None, {}` early to skip invalid cases gracefully. Additionally, to cover potential issues with `find_tugboat_combination` (in case it unexpectedly returns `None` instead of `(None, 0)`), I've added checks to ensure the result is a 2-element tuple before unpacking, continuing to the next candidate if not. I've also checked for empty `candidate_inbounds` and return `None, {}` if no valid times generated. These safeguards prevent unpacking errors while preserving the heuristic's logic, ensuring the function always returns a tuple and handles edge cases from "all data possible" without crashing. The test data's mismatch in HP (demand >> supply) may lead

    """
    Utilization-Balanced (UB) Heuristic: A constructive heuristic that prioritizes unassigned vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i) and attempts to assign the highest-priority vessel to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization. The inbound service start time is centered on the vessel's ETA and adjusted within the average time window flexibility to find a feasible slot. Tugboat combinations are found using the provided helper to minimize the number of tugs (indirectly balancing utilization by efficiency), with availability checks ensuring no conflicts. The assignment is applied only if the post-assignment solution validates fully. This heuristic builds incrementally on partial solutions by assigning one vessel per invocation, promoting balanced resource use across berths and tugs.

    Hyper-parameters in kwargs (with defaults):
    - max_time_adjust (int, default=5): Maximum number of time adjustments around ETA (i.e., candidates = ETA ± max_time_adjust, clipped to time window).
    - time_step (int, default=1): Step size for generating candidate inbound times around ETA.
    - min_tug_util_threshold (float, default=0.8): Skip tug combinations if any selected tug's current utilization exceeds this threshold (to minimize impact on heavily used tugs).

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - current_solution (Solution): Current partial solution instance to build upon.
            - vessel_num (int): Total number of vessels.
            - time_periods (int): Total scheduling horizon in time units.
            - vessel_priority_weights (numpy.ndarray): Priority weights α_i for sorting vessels.
            - vessel_etas (numpy.ndarray): Expected arrival times ETA_i for centering start times.
            - vessel_sizes (numpy.ndarray): Vessel sizes S_i for compatibility.
            - vessel_durations (numpy.ndarray): Berthing durations D_i for availability checks.
            - vessel_inbound_service_times (numpy.ndarray): Inbound service durations τ^in_i.
            - vessel_outbound_service_times (numpy.ndarray): Outbound service durations τ^out_i.
            - vessel_horsepower_requirements (numpy.ndarray): Required HP P^req_i for tug selection.
            - berth_capacities (numpy.ndarray): Berth capacities C_j for compatibility.
            - tugboat_horsepower (numpy.ndarray): Tugboat HP P_k.
            - tugboat_costs (numpy.ndarray): Tugboat costs c_k (unused directly but available).
            - inbound_preparation_time (int): Prep time ρ^in after inbound.
            - outbound_preparation_time (int): Prep time ρ^out after outbound.
            - max_tugboats_per_service (int): H_max limit per service.
            - avg_time_window_flex (float): Average flexibility for time adjustments.
            - get_unassigned_vessels (callable): To get list of unassigned vessel IDs.
            - get_vessel_time_window (callable): To get [earliest, latest] for inbound.
            - get_compatible_berths (callable): Compatible berths for vessel.
            - is_berth_available (callable): Berth availability check.
            - is_tugboat_available (callable): Tugboat availability check.
            - find_tugboat_combination (callable): To find tug combos for services.
            - validation_solution (callable): To validate post-assignment feasibility.
        algorithm_data (dict): Not used in this heuristic (empty dict expected).
        **kwargs: Hyper-parameters as described above.

    Returns:
        CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator: Operator to assign the highest-priority unassigned vessel to a balanced berth/time/tug setup if feasible and valid post-assignment; None if no unassigned vessels or no feasible assignment found for the top vessel.
        dict: Empty dict {} as no algorithm data is updated by this heuristic.

    """
    Utilization-Balanced (UB) Heuristic: A constructive heuristic that prioritizes unassigned vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i) and attempts to assign the highest-priority vessel to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization. The inbound service start time is centered on the vessel's ETA and adjusted within the average time window flexibility to find a feasible slot. Tugboat combinations are found using the provided helper to minimize the number of tugs (indirectly balancing utilization by efficiency), with availability checks ensuring no conflicts. The assignment is applied only if the post-assignment solution validates fully. This heuristic builds incrementally on partial solutions by assigning one vessel per invocation, promoting balanced resource use across berths and tugs.

    Hyper-parameters in kwargs (with defaults):
    - max_time_adjust (int, default=5): Maximum number of time adjustments around ETA (i.e., candidates = ETA ± max_time_adjust, clipped to time window).
    - time_step (int, default=1): Step size for generating candidate inbound times around ETA.
    - min_tug_util_threshold (float, default=0.8): Skip tug combinations if any selected tug's current utilization exceeds this threshold (to minimize impact on heavily used tugs).

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - current_solution (Solution): Current partial solution instance to build upon.
            - vessel_num (int): Total number of vessels.
            - time_periods (int): Total scheduling horizon in time units.
            - vessel_priority_weights (numpy.ndarray): Priority weights α_i for sorting vessels.
            - vessel_etas (numpy.ndarray): Expected arrival times ETA_i for centering start times.
            - vessel_sizes (numpy.ndarray): Vessel sizes S_i for compatibility.
            - vessel_durations (numpy.ndarray): Berthing durations D_i for availability checks.
            - vessel_inbound_service_times (numpy.ndarray): Inbound service durations τ^in_i.
            - vessel_outbound_service_times (numpy.ndarray): Outbound service durations τ^out_i.
            - vessel_horsepower_requirements (numpy.ndarray): Required HP P^req_i for tug selection.
            - berth_capacities (numpy.ndarray): Berth capacities C_j for compatibility.
            - tugboat_horsepower (numpy.ndarray): Tugboat HP P_k.
            - tugboat_costs (numpy.ndarray): Tugboat costs c_k (unused directly but available).
            - inbound_preparation_time (int): Prep time ρ^in after inbound.
            - outbound_preparation_time (int): Prep time ρ^out after outbound.
            - max_tugboats_per_service (int): H_max limit per service.
            - avg_time_window_flex (float): Average flexibility for time adjustments.
            - get_unassigned_vessels (callable): To get list of unassigned vessel IDs.
            - get_vessel_time_window (callable): To get [earliest, latest] for inbound.
            - get_compatible_berths (callable): Compatible berths for vessel.
            - is_berth_available (callable): Berth availability check.
            - is_tugboat_available (callable): Tugboat availability check.
            - find_tugboat_combination (callable): To find tug combos for services.
            - validation_solution (callable): To validate post-assignment feasibility.
        algorithm_data (dict): Not used in this heuristic (empty dict expected).
        **kwargs: Hyper-parameters as described above.

    Returns:
        CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator: Operator to assign the highest-priority unassigned vessel to a balanced berth/time/tug setup if feasible and valid post-assignment; None if no unassigned vessels or no feasible assignment found for the top vessel.
        dict: Empty dict {} as no algorithm data is updated by this heuristic.

    """
    Utilization-Balanced (UB) Heuristic: A constructive heuristic that prioritizes unassigned vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i) and attempts to assign the highest-priority vessel to a compatible berth with the lowest current utilization. The inbound service start time is centered on the vessel's ETA and adjusted within the average time window flexibility to find a feasible slot. Tugboat combinations are found using the provided helper to minimize the number of tugs (indirectly balancing utilization by efficiency), with availability checks ensuring no conflicts. The assignment is applied only if the post-assignment solution validates fully. This heuristic builds incrementally on partial solutions by assigning one vessel per invocation, promoting balanced resource use across berths and tugs.

    Hyper-parameters in kwargs (with defaults):
    - max_time_adjust (int, default=5): Maximum number of time adjustments around ETA (i.e., candidates = ETA ± max_time_adjust, clipped to time window).
    - time_step (int, default=1): Step size for generating candidate inbound times around ETA.
    - min_tug_util_threshold (float, default=0.8): Skip tug combinations if any selected tug's current utilization exceeds this threshold (to minimize impact on heavily used tugs).

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - current_solution (Solution): Current partial solution instance to build upon.
            - vessel_num (int): Total number of vessels.
            - time_periods (int): Total scheduling horizon in time units.
            - vessel_priority_weights (numpy.ndarray): Priority weights α_i for sorting vessels.
            - vessel_etas (numpy.ndarray): Expected arrival times ETA_i for centering start times.
            - vessel_sizes (numpy.ndarray): Vessel sizes S_i for compatibility.
            - vessel_durations (numpy.ndarray): Berthing durations D_i for availability checks.
            - vessel_inbound_service_times (numpy.ndarray): Inbound service durations τ^in_i.
            - vessel_outbound_service_times (numpy.ndarray): Outbound service durations τ^out_i.
            - vessel_horsepower_requirements (numpy.ndarray): Required HP P^req_i for tug selection.
            - berth_capacities (numpy.ndarray): Berth capacities C_j for compatibility.
            - tugboat_horsepower (numpy.ndarray): Tugboat HP P_k.
            - tugboat_costs (numpy.ndarray): Tugboat costs c_k (unused directly but available).
            - inbound_preparation_time (int): Prep time ρ^in after inbound.
            - outbound_preparation_time (int): Prep time ρ^out after outbound.
            - max_tugboats_per_service (int): H_max limit per service.
            - avg_time_window_flex (float): Average flexibility for time adjustments.
            - get_unassigned_vessels (callable): To get list of unassigned vessel IDs.
            - get_vessel_time_window (callable): To get [earliest, latest] for inbound.
            - get_compatible_berths (callable): Compatible berths for vessel.
            - is_berth_available (callable): Berth availability check.
            - is_tugboat_available (callable): Tugboat availability check.
            - find_tugboat_combination (callable): To find tug combos for services.
            - validation_solution (callable): To validate post-assignment feasibility.
        algorithm_data (dict): Not used in this heuristic (empty dict expected).
        **kwargs: Hyper-parameters as described above.

    Returns:
        CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator: Operator to assign the highest-priority unassigned vessel to a balanced berth/time/tug setup if feasible and valid post-assignment; None if no unassigned vessels or no feasible assignment found for the top vessel.
        dict: Empty dict {} as no algorithm data is updated by this heuristic.
