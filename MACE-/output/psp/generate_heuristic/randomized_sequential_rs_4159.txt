I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on psp problem:
Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) - Mathematical Model Description

Problem Overview

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) involves optimal allocation of vessels to berths with coordinated tugboat services. The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.

Key Problem Characteristics

Each vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:
1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth
2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations
3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth

The services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.

Mathematical Model Formulation

Decision Variables
- x_ijt ∈ {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity Cⱼ ≥ vessel size Sᵢ)
- y^in_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t
- y^out_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t
- z^in_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t
- z^out_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t
- u^early_i ≥ 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i
- u^late_i ≥ 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i

Objective Function
Minimize: λ₁Z₁ + λ₂Z₂ + λ₃Z₃ + λ₄Z₄

Where:
- Z₁ = Σᵢ M·αᵢ·(1 - Σⱼ Σₜ x_ijt) [Unserved vessel penalty]
- Z₂ = Σᵢ αᵢ·βᵢ·[Σₜ (t + τ^out_i)·z^out_it - Σₜ t·z^in_it] [Total port time cost]
- Z₃ = Σᵢ αᵢ·γᵢ·(u^early_i + u^late_i) [ETA deviation cost]
- Z₄ = Σₖ Σᵢ Σₜ cₖ·(τ^in_i·y^in_ikt + τ^out_i·y^out_ikt) [Tugboat utilization cost]

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of Port Scheduling Problem supporting multi-tugboat services.

    vessel_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to (berth_id, start_time) tuple. None if vessel is unassigned.
    tugboat_inbound_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to list of tuple (tugboat_id, start_time) for inbound service.

Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

        return Solution(vessel_assignments=new_vessel_assignments, tugboat_inbound_assignments=new_tugboat_inbound, tugboat_outbound_assignments=new_tugboat_outbound)

***is_cop:yes***

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making—such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.

Heuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.

Potential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics.

I need your help to design different 5 basic heuristics for the psp problem.

## Heuristic Requirements:
1. **Constructive Nature**: Each heuristic must be constructive (or constructive followed by improvement), and build solutions step-by-step from scratch.

2. **Diversity**: The 5 heuristics should represent different strategies to ensure diversity in solution approaches.

The problem will work on following data.
Please try to understand the data and generate based on them, especially setting the default value for hyper-parameters:
All data is possible

***heuristic:
Earliest Arrival First (EAF): Sort unassigned vessels by increasing ETA; for each vessel in order, use find_feasible_assignments to select the earliest available assignment within its time window, preferring the compatible berth with highest remaining capacity; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to add the assignment if feasible, tracking total cost.
Largest Vessel First (LVF): Prioritize unassigned vessels by decreasing vessel size (S_i); for each, identify compatible berths via get_compatible_berths, then use find_tugboat_combination for inbound/outbound at the median of the vessel's time window; assign to the berth with lowest current utilization using is_berth_available, applying the operator only if all resources (tugboats via is_tugboat_available) are free.
Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG): Iterate over unassigned vessels in random order; for each, generate up to 5 candidate assignments via find_feasible_assignments, compute costs with calculate_assignment_cost, and select the one with minimal marginal cost increase to total_scheduling_cost; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for the best, updating solution statistics.
Randomized Sequential (RS): Randomly permute all vessel IDs; sequentially attempt assignments starting from an empty solution; for each vessel, sample 3 random start times within get_vessel_time_window, check berth/tugboat availability, and use find_tugboat_combination; apply operator for the first feasible option found, defaulting to unassign if none.
Utilization-Balanced (UB): Sort vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i); for each, select the compatible berth with the lowest current utilization (from berth_utilization stat); center the start time on ETA, adjust by up to avg_time_window_flex to fit availability; find tugboat combos minimizing tug_utilization impact, apply operator if validation_solution passes post-assignment.
***

These heuristics are designed to be constructive, starting from an empty solution (all vessels unassigned) and iteratively building by applying CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator (or UnassignVesselOperator implicitly for failures). Diversity comes from prioritization (ETA, size, cost, random, priority/utilization), selection criteria (earliest, median/random, cost-min, balanced), and use of helpers like find_feasible_assignments for feasibility. Default hyperparameters: max_results=3 in find_feasible_assignments, up to 5 candidates in CMG, sample size=3 in RS; all leverage instance stats (e.g., avg_time_window_flex=mean(Δ^early_i + Δ^late_i)) for robustness. An improvement phase could follow each by re-running on unassigned vessels, but kept basic as per requirements. For implementation, TargetOperatorType would be CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or UnassignVesselOperator, with algorithm_data updated to include iteration count or partial costs.

Based on previous discuss, we get the heuristic Randomized Sequential (RS):
 Randomly permute all vessel IDs; sequentially attempt assignments starting from an empty solution; for each vessel, sample 3 random start times within get_vessel_time_window, check berth/tugboat availability, and use find_tugboat_combination; apply operator for the first feasible option found, defaulting to unassign if none..

Now please implement it in python function randomized_sequential_rs_4159.

To implement this heuristic function in python, please note:
1. We can assume that Solution and all Operators are imported.
2. The operator type must be defined previously, do not create a new one in your code.
3. Never modify the data in problem_state.
4. All hyper parameters in kwargs should be set a default value.
5. Any reasonable partial solution may be used as input, such as an empty solution.
6. Comments in the code are very important. They must clearly explain which hyper-parameters are required by the algorithm (i.e., the parameters in **kwargs), how the algorithm proceeds, and under what circumstances it will not return any operator or will return an empty operator. We hope that people can understand the principles and workflow of the algorithm clearly just by reading the comments, without needing to look at the code.
7. The name of function must be randomized_sequential_rs_4159. The TargetOperatorType should be replaced by real returned operator type.
8. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
9. For the algorithm to update the algorithm_data, do not modify directly "algorithm_data["abc"] = 123", we should return operator, {"abc": 123}.For algorithm that do not update them, just return operator, {}
10. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return None, {}.
11. Do not forget to check whether the content is empty when calculating the min/max/average/std/..., such as when using min([distance[node][other] for other in nodes if other != node]).
12. Make the result must be valid.
13. Do not forget the input problem_state:
problem_state (dict): A dictionary containing the problem state information, organized into five categories of keys:

    """
    Randomized Sequential (RS) heuristic for the Port Scheduling Problem (PSP). This constructive heuristic builds a solution sequentially by processing unassigned vessels in a random order. It starts from the current partial solution and attempts to assign each vessel in the permuted order by sampling random inbound start times within the vessel's time window, checking resource availability for berths and tugboats, and using greedy tugboat combinations. It applies tight scheduling where berthing starts immediately after inbound service completion and outbound starts immediately after berthing. The first feasible assignment found across samples and compatible berths is selected. If no feasible assignment is found for a vessel, it explicitly unassigns it (redundant but as per design). The process is iterative across function calls: algorithm_data maintains the random permutation of unassigned vessels and the current processing index. If the permutation is exhausted or there are no unassigned vessels, no operator is returned.

    This heuristic is diversity-oriented, relying on randomization for exploration, and ensures validity by checking availability constraints before proposing an assignment. It considers partial solutions as input, only targeting currently unassigned vessels. Costs are implicitly handled via feasibility (unserved penalties apply if unassigned; other costs via calculate_assignment_cost if needed, but here focused on feasibility). The result is valid as per helper functions' guarantees.

This implementation faithfully captures the Randomized Sequential heuristic as a step-by-step constructive process suitable for iterative hyper-heuristic application. Each function call handles one vessel from the random sequence, returning an appropriate operator to advance the partial solution toward completeness. The code ensures no modifications to problem_state, uses defaults for hyperparameters, and handles edge cases like empty unassigned lists or invalid time windows. Validity is enforced through the helper functions' checks, which cover all mathematical constraints (e.g., availability includes preparation times, combinations meet HP requirements, tight timing satisfies sequence constraints within epsilon). If needed, an optional post-operator validation via validation_solution could be added, but it's omitted for efficiency as the checks are comprehensive. The algorithm_data enables stateful sequential building without regenerating the full permutation unnecessarily, promoting efficiency in repeated calls. For costs, while not explicitly computed here (focus on feasibility for constructive step), the returned assignment would integrate into total_scheduling_cost upon application, including all Z1-Z4 components.

***expected_result: The function should return a tuple consisting of a CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator instance and a dictionary. The operator assigns the first vessel from a newly generated random permutation of the 100 unassigned vessel IDs to a compatible berth at a feasible berthing start time derived from one of the sampled inbound start times (randomly chosen within the vessel's time window), with inbound and outbound tugboat combinations found via find_tugboat_combination (greedy or exhaustive, ensuring HP requirements met and all tugboats start at the same time, with availability guaranteed since solution is empty). The berthing start is immediately after inbound service, outbound immediately after berthing (tight scheduling within epsilon tolerance). The dictionary updates algorithm_data with 'permutation': the shuffled list of 100 vessel IDs, and 'current_index': 1 (advancing after processing the first vessel). If the first vessel cannot be assigned (e.g., due to HP mismatch or invalid window), it returns UnassignVesselOperator for that vessel and the same updated dict; however, given the empty solution and instance stats (total_available_hp=80275 sufficient for individual vessels despite aggregate mismatch), a successful assignment is highly likely. No None operator, as unassigned_vessels=100 >0 and index=0 < len(permutation).***

In this smoke test with an empty solution, the heuristic initializes and processes the first vessel successfully due to full resource availability, advancing the partial solution by one assignment. The random nature means exact vessel_id, times, berth_id, and tugboats vary, but the structure ensures validity per helpers (e.g., compatible berths, available resources, HP satisfaction). The partial_objective_value will update post-application to reflect Z1 reduction (one less unserved) plus added Z2/Z3/Z4, while assigned_vessels_fraction becomes 0.01, etc. If total_available_hp were insufficient even for one vessel, it would unassign, but stats suggest per-vessel feasibility. This confirms the code's constructive step works as intended for iterative building.

Please compare with your expected result: The function should return a tuple consisting of a CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator instance and a dictionary. The operator assigns the first vessel from a newly generated random permutation of the 100 unassigned vessel IDs to a compatible berth at a feasible berthing start time derived from one of the sampled inbound start times (randomly chosen within the vessel's time window), with inbound and outbound tugboat combinations found via find_tugboat_combination (greedy or exhaustive, ensuring HP requirements met and all tugboats start at the same time, with availability guaranteed since solution is empty). The berthing start is immediately after inbound service, outbound immediately after berthing (tight scheduling within epsilon tolerance). The dictionary updates algorithm_data with 'permutation': the shuffled list of 100 vessel IDs, and 'current_index': 1 (advancing after processing the first vessel). If the first vessel cannot be assigned (e.g., due to HP mismatch or invalid window), it returns UnassignVesselOperator for that vessel and the same updated dict; however, given the empty solution and instance stats (total_available_hp=80275 sufficient for individual vessels despite aggregate mismatch), a successful assignment is highly likely. No None operator, as unassigned_vessels=100 >0 and index=0 < len(permutation).

The test output perfectly aligns with the expected behavior. The random permutation selected vessel 4 as the first to process (randomness in shuffle), and the assignment details confirm tight scheduling: inbound at time 6 (sampled within window), berthing at 7 (post-inbound duration), outbound at 9 (post-berthing duration), using the same tugboat 8 for both services (likely greedy selection found it sufficient for HP, and availability holds in empty solution). The operator type and structure match, solution updates as anticipated (one assignment added, stats reflect partial progress), and no violations or None returned. This validates the code's constructive step, randomization, feasibility checks via helpers, and algorithm_data advancement for sequential use. Ready to proceed or save.

To ensure the stable of heuristics, we adjust the code to:

def randomized_sequential_rs_4159(problem_state: dict, algorithm_data: dict, **kwargs) -> Tuple[Union[CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator, UnassignVesselOperator, None], Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Randomized Sequential (RS) heuristic for the Port Scheduling Problem (PSP). This constructive heuristic builds a solution sequentially by processing unassigned vessels in a random order. It starts from the current partial solution and attempts to assign each vessel in the permuted order by sampling random inbound start times within the vessel's time window, checking resource availability for berths and tugboats, and using greedy tugboat combinations. It applies tight scheduling where berthing starts immediately after inbound service completion and outbound starts immediately after berthing. The first feasible assignment found across samples and compatible berths is selected. If no feasible assignment is found for a vessel, it explicitly unassigns it (redundant but as per design). The process is iterative across function calls: algorithm_data maintains the random permutation of unassigned vessels and the current processing index. If the permutation is exhausted or there are no unassigned vessels, no operator is returned.

    This heuristic is diversity-oriented, relying on randomization for exploration, and ensures validity by checking availability constraints before proposing an assignment. It considers partial solutions as input, only targeting currently unassigned vessels. Costs are implicitly handled via feasibility (unserved penalties apply if unassigned; other costs via calculate_assignment_cost if needed, but here focused on feasibility). The result is valid as per helper functions' guarantees.

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - current_solution (Solution): Current partial solution instance, used as starting point for assignments.
            - get_unassigned_vessels (callable): Function to retrieve list of unassigned vessel IDs from the current solution.
            - get_vessel_time_window (callable): Function to get (earliest_start, latest_start) for a vessel's inbound service.
            - get_compatible_berths (callable): Function to get list of compatible berth IDs for a vessel.
            - is_berth_available (callable): Function to check berth availability for a time slot.
            - is_tugboat_available (callable): Function to check tugboat availability including preparation time.
            - find_tugboat_combination (callable): Function to find a valid tugboat combination for inbound/outbound service.
            - vessel_sizes (numpy.ndarray): Array of vessel sizes (S_i) for compatibility checks.
            - vessel_durations (numpy.ndarray): Array of berthing durations (D_i).
            - vessel_inbound_service_times (numpy.ndarray): Array of inbound service durations (tau^in_i).

            - time_constraint_tolerance (float): Tolerance for timing sequences (epsilon_time), used implicitly in tight scheduling.
        algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, the following items are used:
            - permutation (list[int]): Stored random permutation of unassigned vessel IDs; if absent, a new one is generated.
            - current_index (int): Current index in the permutation to process; defaults to 0 if absent.
        **kwargs: Hyper-parameters for the algorithm.

            - If there are unassigned vessels and index < len(permutation), returns the operator (CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for feasible assignment or UnassignVesselOperator if no feasible option found) for the current vessel, and updated algorithm_data with advanced current_index.
            - If no unassigned vessels or permutation exhausted (current_index >= len(permutation)), returns (None, {}).
            - Updated algorithm_data contains 'permutation' and 'current_index' for sequential processing; empty dict if no update needed.
