I am working on Hyper-heuristics for Combinatorial Operation (CO) problem.

Currently, I am working on psp problem:
Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) - Mathematical Model Description

Problem Overview

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) involves optimal allocation of vessels to berths with coordinated tugboat services. The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.

Key Problem Characteristics

Each vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:
1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth
2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations
3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth

The services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.

Mathematical Model Formulation

Decision Variables
- x_ijt ∈ {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity Cⱼ ≥ vessel size Sᵢ)
- y^in_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t
- y^out_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t
- z^in_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t
- z^out_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t
- u^early_i ≥ 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i
- u^late_i ≥ 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i

Objective Function
Minimize: λ₁Z₁ + λ₂Z₂ + λ₃Z₃ + λ₄Z₄

Where:
- Z₁ = Σᵢ M·αᵢ·(1 - Σⱼ Σₜ x_ijt) [Unserved vessel penalty]
- Z₂ = Σᵢ αᵢ·βᵢ·[Σₜ (t + τ^out_i)·z^out_it - Σₜ t·z^in_it] [Total port time cost]
- Z₃ = Σᵢ αᵢ·γᵢ·(u^early_i + u^late_i) [ETA deviation cost]
- Z₄ = Σₖ Σᵢ Σₜ cₖ·(τ^in_i·y^in_ikt + τ^out_i·y^out_ikt) [Tugboat utilization cost]

To support different heuristic algorithms, I build the Solution and Operator framework.
The Solution is designed as:
class Solution:
    """The solution of Port Scheduling Problem supporting multi-tugboat services.

    vessel_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to (berth_id, start_time) tuple. None if vessel is unassigned.
    tugboat_inbound_assignments (dict): Maps vessel_id to list of tuple (tugboat_id, start_time) for inbound service.

Operator servers as a mechanism to modify solution, which enables the application of heuristic algorithms. 
To support heuristic algorithm, we have build the following operators:

***is_cop:yes***

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) is indeed a classic example of a combinatorial optimization (CO) problem. It involves discrete decision-making—such as assigning vessels to specific berths at discrete times, selecting combinations of tugboats for inbound/outbound services, and ensuring feasibility under constraints like capacity, horsepower requirements, timing sequences, and resource availability. The objective is to minimize a multi-component cost function (penalties for unserved vessels, port time, ETA deviations, and tugboat usage), which aligns with CO characteristics: a finite search space of feasible combinations, NP-hard complexity due to scheduling and resource allocation interdependencies, and the need for optimization over exponential possibilities.

Heuristics (and hyper-heuristics) are well-suited for solving PSP, as exact methods (e.g., MILP solvers) may be intractable for realistic instances with large time horizons, multiple vessels, berths, and tugboats. Your framework supports this effectively: the Solution class encapsulates the state (assignments for vessels and tugboats), operators like CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator and UnassignVesselOperator enable local search/modifications, and the provided helper functions (e.g., find_tugboat_combination, find_feasible_assignments) facilitate greedy, nearest-neighbor, or metaheuristic approaches. The heuristic signature allows generating targeted operators (e.g., for assigning unserved vessels or resolving conflicts) while updating algorithm data for iterative improvement, making it extensible for methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or hyper-heuristic selection.

Potential enhancements: Consider adding operators for swapping assignments between vessels or adjusting timings to handle dynamic densities (using instance stats like vessel_arrival_density). Validation via the mathematical constraints ensures heuristic-generated solutions remain feasible or quantifiable in terms of violations. Overall, the setup is solid and correctly oriented toward CO heuristics.

I need your help to design different 5 basic heuristics for the psp problem.

## Heuristic Requirements:
1. **Constructive Nature**: Each heuristic must be constructive (or constructive followed by improvement), and build solutions step-by-step from scratch.

2. **Diversity**: The 5 heuristics should represent different strategies to ensure diversity in solution approaches.

The problem will work on following data.
Please try to understand the data and generate based on them, especially setting the default value for hyper-parameters:
All data is possible

***heuristic:
Earliest Arrival First (EAF): Sort unassigned vessels by increasing ETA; for each vessel in order, use find_feasible_assignments to select the earliest available assignment within its time window, preferring the compatible berth with highest remaining capacity; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to add the assignment if feasible, tracking total cost.
Largest Vessel First (LVF): Prioritize unassigned vessels by decreasing vessel size (S_i); for each, identify compatible berths via get_compatible_berths, then use find_tugboat_combination for inbound/outbound at the median of the vessel's time window; assign to the berth with lowest current utilization using is_berth_available, applying the operator only if all resources (tugboats via is_tugboat_available) are free.
Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG): Iterate over unassigned vessels in random order; for each, generate up to 5 candidate assignments via find_feasible_assignments, compute costs with calculate_assignment_cost, and select the one with minimal marginal cost increase to total_scheduling_cost; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for the best, updating solution statistics.
Randomized Sequential (RS): Randomly permute all vessel IDs; sequentially attempt assignments starting from an empty solution; for each vessel, sample 3 random start times within get_vessel_time_window, check berth/tugboat availability, and use find_tugboat_combination; apply operator for the first feasible option found, defaulting to unassign if none.
Utilization-Balanced (UB): Sort vessels by decreasing priority weight (α_i); for each, select the compatible berth with the lowest current utilization (from berth_utilization stat); center the start time on ETA, adjust by up to avg_time_window_flex to fit availability; find tugboat combos minimizing tug_utilization impact, apply operator if validation_solution passes post-assignment.
***

These heuristics are designed to be constructive, starting from an empty solution (all vessels unassigned) and iteratively building by applying CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator (or UnassignVesselOperator implicitly for failures). Diversity comes from prioritization (ETA, size, cost, random, priority/utilization), selection criteria (earliest, median/random, cost-min, balanced), and use of helpers like find_feasible_assignments for feasibility. Default hyperparameters: max_results=3 in find_feasible_assignments, up to 5 candidates in CMG, sample size=3 in RS; all leverage instance stats (e.g., avg_time_window_flex=mean(Δ^early_i + Δ^late_i)) for robustness. An improvement phase could follow each by re-running on unassigned vessels, but kept basic as per requirements. For implementation, TargetOperatorType would be CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or UnassignVesselOperator, with algorithm_data updated to include iteration count or partial costs.

Based on previous discuss, we get the heuristic Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG):
 Iterate over unassigned vessels in random order; for each, generate up to 5 candidate assignments via find_feasible_assignments, compute costs with calculate_assignment_cost, and select the one with minimal marginal cost increase to total_scheduling_cost; apply CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for the best, updating solution statistics..

Now please implement it in python function cost_minimizing_greedy_cmg_b900.

To implement this heuristic function in python, please note:
1. We can assume that Solution and all Operators are imported.
2. The operator type must be defined previously, do not create a new one in your code.
3. Never modify the data in problem_state.
4. All hyper parameters in kwargs should be set a default value.
5. Any reasonable partial solution may be used as input, such as an empty solution.
6. Comments in the code are very important. They must clearly explain which hyper-parameters are required by the algorithm (i.e., the parameters in **kwargs), how the algorithm proceeds, and under what circumstances it will not return any operator or will return an empty operator. We hope that people can understand the principles and workflow of the algorithm clearly just by reading the comments, without needing to look at the code.
7. The name of function must be cost_minimizing_greedy_cmg_b900. The TargetOperatorType should be replaced by real returned operator type.
8. No any omissions or placeholders, I'm just going to use the code.
9. For the algorithm to update the algorithm_data, do not modify directly "algorithm_data["abc"] = 123", we should return operator, {"abc": 123}.For algorithm that do not update them, just return operator, {}
10. For the circumstances that algorithm return empty operator, please return None, {}.
11. Do not forget to check whether the content is empty when calculating the min/max/average/std/..., such as when using min([distance[node][other] for other in nodes if other != node]).
12. Make the result must be valid.
13. Do not forget the input problem_state:
problem_state (dict): A dictionary containing the problem state information, organized into five categories of keys:

    """
    Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG) heuristic for the Port Scheduling Problem (PSP). This constructive heuristic starts from a partial solution and iteratively assigns one unassigned vessel at a time. In each invocation, it randomly selects one unassigned vessel, generates up to num_candidates feasible complete assignments (berth + multi-tugboat inbound/outbound services) using ETA-centered search, selects the one with the minimal assignment cost (which minimizes the marginal increase to the total scheduling cost by replacing the unserved penalty with assignment costs Z2+Z3+Z4), and returns the corresponding CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to apply. The marginal cost increase is calculated as (assignment_cost - unserved_penalty), where unserved_penalty = lambda_1 * M * alpha_i; negative values indicate improvements. If no unassigned vessels remain or no feasible assignment is found for the selected vessel, returns (None, {}). This enables step-by-step construction over multiple calls, with random selection ensuring diverse ordering across invocations. The result is valid as find_feasible_assignments ensures constraint satisfaction (timing, capacity, horsepower, availability).

    Hyper-parameters in kwargs:
        - num_candidates (int, default=5): Maximum number of candidate assignments to generate via find_feasible_assignments (passed as max_results). Higher values increase exploration but computational time.

            - total_scheduling_cost (float): Current total scheduling cost, used contextually for marginal increase understanding (not directly modified).
            - get_unassigned_vessels (callable): Function to retrieve list of unassigned vessel IDs from the current solution.
            - find_feasible_assignments (callable): Function to generate feasible assignment candidates for a vessel, returning list of dicts with 'berth_id', 'start_time', 'inbound_tugboats', 'outbound_tugboats', 'total_cost'.
            - objective_weights (numpy.ndarray): Array of lambda coefficients [lambda_1, ...] for objective components.
            - penalty_parameter (float): Large penalty M for unserved vessels in Z1.
            - vessel_priority_weights (numpy.ndarray): Array of alpha_i priorities for vessels.

            - vessel_durations (numpy.ndarray): Array of D_i berthing durations (accessible if needed for internal checks, though not directly used).
            (Optional and can be omitted if no algorithm data) algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, no specific items are necessary; it operates independently per call.

    Returns:
        tuple[CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or None, dict]: Returns the operator to assign the selected vessel with the best candidate if feasible, along with updated algorithm_data containing 'selected_vessel' (int): ID of assigned vessel, 'marginal_cost' (float): Marginal increase to total_scheduling_cost, 'assignment_cost' (float): Z2+Z3+Z4 cost of the assignment.

This implementation adheres to the requirements: it processes partial solutions, considers all objective components in marginal cost (replacing Z1 penalty with Z2+Z3+Z4), uses helpers for validity, sets default num_candidates=5, and returns a single valid operator per call for step-by-step construction. Random selection per call simulates iterating in random order over multiple invocations. No direct modification of problem_state; all accesses are read-only. Comments in the docstring explain hyperparameters (num_candidates), workflow (steps 1-7), and return conditions (None when no unassigned or no candidates). For empty lists, checks like if not unassigned_vessels or not candidates handle omissions safely. The code is complete, import-ready, and assumes the helper find_feasible_assignments can return up to max_results candidates (e.g., by trying multiple nearby times until max_results feasible ones are found, aligning with the CMG intent despite the helper's "first found" note). If the helper strictly returns only one, set num_candidates=1, but the code is flexible.

***expected_result:A tuple containing a CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator instance for a randomly selected unassigned vessel (vessel_id between 0 and 99) with a feasible assignment (berth_id from 0-14, start_time near the vessel's ETA within its time window, inbound_tugboats and outbound_tugboats as lists of (tugboat_id, start_time) tuples meeting horsepower requirements and availability), and a dict {'selected_vessel': int (the chosen vessel_id), 'marginal_cost': float (assignment_cost - unserved_penalty, likely negative indicating improvement), 'assignment_cost': float (the minimal Z2+Z3+Z4 cost from candidates)}. If find_feasible_assignments returns no candidates for the selected vessel (unlikely in empty solution but possible if vessel's P^req_i > total_available_hp or time conflicts, though empty allows flexibility), returns (None, {}). The operator ensures validity per helper functions, reducing unassigned_vessels by 1 and partial_objective_value by the marginal_cost upon application.***

The expected result aligns with the code's logic: in an empty solution, unassigned_vessels=100 >0, so it proceeds to select one randomly (output varies per run due to random.choice), generates candidates (up to 5, but helper description says "returns immediately upon finding the first valid", so potentially 1-5 if modified, but code handles list and min works on non-empty), picks the cheapest (min total_cost), computes marginal (replacing part of Z1 penalty with Z2+Z3+Z4), and returns the operator to assign it. Given total_available_hp=80275 < total_required_hp=346107, individual assignments are feasible initially (avg per vessel ~3461 HP, with 30 tugboats likely sufficient for one), but cumulative will hit limits later. No None expected in first run unless specific vessel incompatibility (e.g., size > all berths, but berth_capacity_ratio=1.01 suggests tight but possible). Smoke test verifies non-empty return, random selection, and dict updates without errors.

Please compare with your expected result: A tuple containing a CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator instance for a randomly selected unassigned vessel (vessel_id between 0 and 99) with a feasible assignment (berth_id from 0-14, start_time near the vessel's ETA within its time window, inbound_tugboats and outbound_tugboats as lists of (tugboat_id, start_time) tuples meeting horsepower requirements and availability), and a dict {'selected_vessel': int (the chosen vessel_id), 'marginal_cost': float (assignment_cost - unserved_penalty, likely negative indicating improvement), 'assignment_cost': float (the minimal Z2+Z3+Z4 cost from candidates)}. If find_feasible_assignments returns no candidates for the selected vessel (unlikely in empty solution but possible if vessel's P^req_i > total_available_hp or time conflicts, though empty allows flexibility), returns (None, {}). The operator ensures validity per helper functions, reducing unassigned_vessels by 1 and partial_objective_value by the marginal_cost upon application.

The test result fully aligns with the expected output: the function returned a valid CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator for a randomly selected vessel (25), with feasible assignment details (berth 0 at time 10, tugboat 8 for inbound at 8 and outbound at 12, respecting sequencing: inbound ends before berthing starts, berthing ends before outbound). The updated solution and stats reflect proper application—e.g., objective value decreased by ~1068.43 (marginal_cost ≈ -1068, as unserved_penalty was replaced by lower assignment_cost), unassigned reduced by 1, utilizations increased minimally, no conflicts (potential_conflict_ratio=0.0), and remaining_hp_demand dropped by vessel 25's requirement (~3568 HP assumed). This confirms the code's logic, helper integrations, and validity enforcement work as intended in an empty/partial solution context. No fixes needed.

To ensure the stable of heuristics, we adjust the code to:
from src.problems.psp.components import *
import random

def cost_minimizing_greedy_cmg_b900(problem_state: dict, algorithm_data: dict, **kwargs) -> tuple[CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator, dict]:
    """
    Cost-Minimizing Greedy (CMG) heuristic for the Port Scheduling Problem (PSP). This constructive heuristic starts from a partial solution and iteratively assigns one unassigned vessel at a time. In each invocation, it randomly selects one unassigned vessel, generates up to num_candidates feasible complete assignments (berth + multi-tugboat inbound/outbound services) using ETA-centered search, selects the one with the minimal assignment cost (which minimizes the marginal increase to the total scheduling cost by replacing the unserved penalty with assignment costs Z2+Z3+Z4), and returns the corresponding CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator to apply. The marginal cost increase is calculated as (assignment_cost - unserved_penalty), where unserved_penalty = lambda_1 * M * alpha_i; negative values indicate improvements. If no unassigned vessels remain or no feasible assignment is found for the selected vessel, returns (None, {}). This enables step-by-step construction over multiple calls, with random selection ensuring diverse ordering across invocations. The result is valid as find_feasible_assignments ensures constraint satisfaction (timing, capacity, horsepower, availability).

    Hyper-parameters in kwargs:
        - num_candidates (int, default=5): Maximum number of candidate assignments to generate via find_feasible_assignments (passed as max_results). Higher values increase exploration but computational time.

    Args:
        problem_state (dict): The dictionary contains the problem state. In this algorithm, the following items are necessary:
            - current_solution (Solution): Current partial solution instance to check availability and build upon.
            - total_scheduling_cost (float): Current total scheduling cost, used contextually for marginal increase understanding (not directly modified).
            - get_unassigned_vessels (callable): Function to retrieve list of unassigned vessel IDs from the current solution.
            - find_feasible_assignments (callable): Function to generate feasible assignment candidates for a vessel, returning list of dicts with 'berth_id', 'start_time', 'inbound_tugboats', 'outbound_tugboats', 'total_cost'.
            - objective_weights (numpy.ndarray): Array of lambda coefficients [lambda_1, ...] for objective components.
            - penalty_parameter (float): Large penalty M for unserved vessels in Z1.
            - vessel_priority_weights (numpy.ndarray): Array of alpha_i priorities for vessels.
            - vessel_num (int): Total number of vessels (for ID validation).
            - vessel_durations (numpy.ndarray): Array of D_i berthing durations (accessible if needed for internal checks, though not directly used).
            (Optional and can be omitted if no algorithm data) algorithm_data (dict): The algorithm dictionary for current algorithm only. In this algorithm, no specific items are necessary; it operates independently per call.

    Returns:
        tuple[CompleteVesselAssignmentOperator or None, dict]: Returns the operator to assign the selected vessel with the best candidate if feasible, along with updated algorithm_data containing 'selected_vessel' (int): ID of assigned vessel, 'marginal_cost' (float): Marginal increase to total_scheduling_cost, 'assignment_cost' (float): Z2+Z3+Z4 cost of the assignment. If no action possible (no unassigned vessels or no feasible candidates), returns (None, {}).
