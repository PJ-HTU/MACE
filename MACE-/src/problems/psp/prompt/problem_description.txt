Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) - Mathematical Model Description

Problem Overview

The Port Scheduling Problem (PSP) involves optimal allocation of vessels to berths with coordinated tugboat services. The system manages multiple berths with different capacity levels, multiple tugboats with varying horsepower capabilities, and multiple vessels with specific requirements and time constraints.

Key Problem Characteristics

Each vessel must receive three sequential services if allocated:
1. Inbound tugboat service - to guide vessel to berth
2. Berthing service - vessel occupies berth for cargo operations
3. Outbound tugboat service - to guide vessel away from berth

The services must be properly sequenced and temporally connected within allowable time tolerances. Vessels that cannot receive complete service are penalized heavily.

Mathematical Model Formulation

Decision Variables
- x_ijt ∈ {0,1}: vessel i starts berthing at berth j at time t (only if berth capacity Cⱼ ≥ vessel size Sᵢ)
- y^in_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts inbound service for vessel i at time t
- y^out_ikt ∈ {0,1}: tugboat k starts outbound service for vessel i at time t
- z^in_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts inbound tugboat service at time t
- z^out_it ∈ {0,1}: auxiliary variable indicating vessel i starts outbound tugboat service at time t
- u^early_i ≥ 0: early deviation from ETA for vessel i
- u^late_i ≥ 0: late deviation from ETA for vessel i

Objective Function
Minimize: λ₁Z₁ + λ₂Z₂ + λ₃Z₃ + λ₄Z₄

Where:
- Z₁ = Σᵢ M·αᵢ·(1 - Σⱼ Σₜ x_ijt) [Unserved vessel penalty]
- Z₂ = Σᵢ αᵢ·βᵢ·[Σₜ (t + τ^out_i)·z^out_it - Σₜ t·z^in_it] [Total port time cost]
- Z₃ = Σᵢ αᵢ·γᵢ·(u^early_i + u^late_i) [ETA deviation cost]
- Z₄ = Σₖ Σᵢ Σₜ cₖ·(τ^in_i·y^in_ikt + τ^out_i·y^out_ikt) [Tugboat utilization cost]
