Your previously generated action space code for the {problem} problem encountered an error during smoke testing.

## Error Message
{error_message}

## Your Previous Code
{old_code}

## Your Task
Please fix the error in the code while maintaining the original design intent and structure.

### Common Issues to Check
1. **Import errors**: Make sure all necessary imports are included
2. **Type errors**: Verify parameter types match expected types
3. **Logic errors**: Check if the action logic is correct
4. **Syntax errors**: Look for Python syntax mistakes
5. **Solution modification**: Ensure you create NEW solutions instead of modifying inputs

### Requirements
- Fix the specific error mentioned above
- Preserve the original algorithmic logic as much as possible
- Ensure all actions inherit from `BaseOperator` correctly
- Ensure all actions have proper `__init__` and `run` methods
- Do NOT modify the input solution in `run` method - always create a new one

## Output Format
Provide your corrected code in this format:

***python_code:
# Your COMPLETE corrected action space code here
# Include all imports
# Include all action classes (both constructive and improvement)

from src.problems.base.components import BaseOperator
# Other imports...

# All your action classes
***

CRITICAL:
- Only put code inside ***python_code:...*** markers
- Include the COMPLETE code (all actions, all imports)
- The code should be ready to execute without modifications
