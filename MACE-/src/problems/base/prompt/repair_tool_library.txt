Your previously generated tool library code for the {problem} problem encountered an error during smoke testing.

## Error Message
{error_message}

## Your Previous Code
{old_code}

## Your Task

Fix the error in the tool library code while maintaining the original functionality.

### Common Issues to Check

1. **Import Errors**
   - Missing imports (numpy, typing, etc.)
   - Incorrect module paths
   - Circular import issues

2. **Type Errors**
   - Incorrect type hints
   - Mismatched parameter types
   - Wrong return types

3. **Logic Errors**
   - Index out of bounds
   - Division by zero
   - Empty list/array access
   - None value access

4. **Syntax Errors**
   - Missing colons, parentheses
   - Incorrect indentation
   - Invalid Python syntax

5. **Function Signature Issues**
   - Missing required parameters
   - Incorrect default values
   - Parameter order problems

### Requirements

- Fix the specific error mentioned above
- Preserve all tool functions and their functionality
- Ensure all functions have proper docstrings
- Maintain efficient implementations
- Handle edge cases properly
- Do NOT modify function inputs (solutions, instance_data, etc.)

### Testing Checklist

After fixing, verify:
- [ ] All imports are correct
- [ ] All functions have proper signatures
- [ ] All functions have docstrings
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (empty solutions, etc.)
- [ ] No input modification occurs
- [ ] Type hints are correct

## Output Format

Provide your corrected code in this format:

***python_code:
# Corrected Tool Library for {problem}
# Fixed: [brief description of what was fixed]

import numpy as np
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Optional, Set
# Other necessary imports...

# Include ALL tool functions (corrected and unchanged ones)

def tool_function_1(...):
    """Docstring."""
    # Implementation
    pass

def tool_function_2(...):
    """Docstring."""
    # Implementation
    pass

# ... all other tool functions
***

CRITICAL:
- Only put code inside ***python_code:...*** markers
- Include the COMPLETE tool library (all functions, all imports)
- The code should be ready to execute without any modifications
- Add a comment at the top briefly explaining what was fixed
