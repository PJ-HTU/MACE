You are an expert in combinatorial optimization and algorithm design.

I am working on the {problem} problem:
{task_description}

Your task is to design **Constructive Actions** for this problem. Constructive actions are operators that incrementally build a solution from scratch by adding elements step by step.

## Requirements

### 1. Action Categories
Design at least 2-3 different constructive action operators that cover different construction strategies:
- **Append-based actions**: Add elements to the end of the current partial solution
- **Insert-based actions**: Insert elements at specific positions in the partial solution
- **Other construction strategies**: Any other meaningful ways to incrementally construct a solution

### 2. Code Structure
Each action should be implemented as a Python class that:
- Inherits from `BaseOperator`
- Has a clear `__init__` method with necessary parameters
- Implements a `run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution` method that applies the action
- Does NOT modify the input solution (create a new solution instead)

### 3. Code Format
```python
class YourActionName(BaseOperator):
    """Clear documentation of what this action does."""
    
    def __init__(self, param1: type, param2: type, ...):
        """Initialize the action with necessary parameters."""
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
        # Store other parameters
    
    def run(self, solution: Solution) -> Solution:
        """
        Apply this action to the solution.
        
        Args:
            solution: The current solution to be modified
            
        Returns:
            A NEW solution with the action applied (do not modify input)
        """
        # Your implementation here
        # CRITICAL: Create a new solution, don't modify the input
        new_solution_data = # ... construct new solution data
        return Solution(new_solution_data)
```

### 4. Design Principles
- **Completeness**: Cover different construction strategies
- **Efficiency**: Actions should be computationally lightweight
- **Generality**: Actions should work for any valid problem instance
- **Safety**: Never modify the input solution directly

### 5. Examples to Inspire (for TSP)
For TSP, constructive actions might include:
- `AppendOperator(node)`: Append a node to the end of the tour
- `InsertOperator(node, position)`: Insert a node at a specific position
- `BestInsertOperator(node)`: Insert a node at the position that minimizes cost increase

## Output Format
Please provide your complete Python code wrapped in ***python_code:...*** markers:

***python_code:
# Your complete constructive actions code here
# Include ALL necessary imports at the top
# Include ALL action classes

from src.problems.base.components import BaseOperator
# Add other necessary imports

class Action1(BaseOperator):
    # Implementation
    pass

class Action2(BaseOperator):
    # Implementation  
    pass

# Add more actions as needed
***

IMPORTANT: 
- Only provide code inside the ***python_code:...*** markers
- Do NOT include explanations inside the markers
- You can add analysis and explanation OUTSIDE the markers
