- instance_data:
    - node_num (int): The total number of nodes in the problem.
    - distance_matrix (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array representing the distances between nodes.

- solution:
    - current_solution (Solution): Current solution instance.

- key_item:
    - current_cost (int): The total cost of the current solution.

- helper_function:
    - get_problem_state (callable): def get_problem_state(solution: Solution) -> dict: The function to get the complete problem state for given solution without modifying it. Returns a dictionary containing 'total_scheduling_cost' and other state information.
    - validation_solution (callable): def validation_solution(solution: Solution = None) -> bool: The function to check whether the solution is valid according to all mathematical model constraints. If solution is None, checks current solution. Returns True if valid, False otherwise.
    - get_unvisited_nodes (callable): def get_unvisited_nodes(solution: Solution = None) -> list[int]: Get list of node IDs that have not been visited in the tour. Returns all nodes from 0 to node_num-1 that are not present in the current tour. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns list of integers representing unvisited node IDs.
    - get_insertion_cost (callable): def get_insertion_cost(node: int, position: int, solution: Solution = None) -> float: Calculate the cost increase when inserting a node at a specific position in the tour. Handles three cases: insertion at beginning (position=0), at end (position=len(tour)), or in middle (between position-1 and position). For middle insertion, returns new_edges_cost minus removed_edge_cost. For empty tour, returns 0.0. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns float representing the tour length increase caused by the insertion.
    - get_min_distance_to_tour (callable): def get_min_distance_to_tour(node: int, solution: Solution = None) -> float: Calculate the minimum distance from a given node to any node currently in the tour. Useful for nearest/farthest insertion heuristics to find the closest tour node to an unvisited node. If solution is None, uses current solution. Returns float representing the minimum distance; returns inf if the tour is empty.
    - find_closest_pair (callable): def find_closest_pair(nodes: list = None) -> tuple[int, int, float]: Find the pair of nodes with the smallest distance between them from a given node list. If nodes is None, searches among all nodes (0 to node_num-1). Returns tuple of (node1, node2, distance) where node1 and node2 are the indices of the closest pair and distance is their distance value.
