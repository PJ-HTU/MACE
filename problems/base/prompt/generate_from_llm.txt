I need your help to design different 5 basic heuristics for the {problem} problem.

## Heuristic Requirements:
1. **Constructive Nature**: Each heuristic must be constructive (or constructive followed by improvement), and build solutions step-by-step from scratch.

2. **Diversity**: The 5 heuristics should represent different strategies to ensure diversity in solution approaches.

The problem will work on following data.
Please try to understand the data and generate based on them, especially setting the default value for hyper-parameters:
{env_summarize}

The response format is very important. For better communication, please respond to me in this format:
***heuristic:
heuristic_name: only text description
heuristic_name: only text description
....
***
Ensure there is no other content (including blank lines) inside the ***, and analysis outside *** is welcome.
If you have no information to provide, simply respond with ***None***.
